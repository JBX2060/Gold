					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There is a term called Deterministic Wallet in the Armory software. I checked some English-Chinese dictionaries but got no answer yet. Who can give me an explanation for this? Thanks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A deterministic wallet is a wallet that you need to backup only once. <br />It creates all your Bitcoin addresses from a random number called &quot;seed&quot;.<br />Your wallet can be recovered from the seed, if the wallet file is accidentally deleted.<br /><br />That is an important security feature, because it protects you from your own mistakes, or computer crashes.<br /><br />the following clients have deterministic wallets:<br />&nbsp;- Electrum<br />&nbsp;- Armory<br />&nbsp;- Bitcoinspinner<br /><br />the official Bitcoin client might support deterministic wallets in the future; google for &quot;Bitcoin BIP 32&quot;<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks a lot for your quick and kind replies. It&#039;s very helpful for me - a newbie in this field. <br /><br />Sorry, I have one more question here: How to transfer the Btcs in my online Armory (watching-only wallet copy) into another offline Armory (on another old laptop) via a USB flash stick? <br /><br />After having carefully refered to the Amory tutorials on their webpages, I&#039;ve successfully made installation of Armory on my offline laptop as well as on an everyday-using desktop pc. I&#039;ve also made a watching-only wallet on the desktop and sent from my another address 0.25 Btcs to the online Armory (watching-only wallet copy). <br /><br />Now my question is: Shall I transfer the money via USB flash stick back to the offline Armory? And if I should, how to do it? I&#039;ve earnestly checked the help text on their webpages but got no clue. Thanks again! &nbsp;:)<br /><br /><a href="http://s1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/625918c2td1799162db40&amp;690">http://s1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/625918c2td1799162db40&amp;690</a></div>

Go to your online wallet, and send your Bitcoins to the offline wallet address.<br />The coins will be sent to the offline address, even if the offline wallet is never connected to the Internet.<br /><br /><b>If you just want to access your wallet on the offline computer </b>(not send coins to it), just put your wallet.dat onto a USB, and import it on the offline machine.<br /><br /><b>Tip me:</b> 1234568syWuTdAMp1Fxg3hroz2F1W5VvDS<br /><br />Good luck!</div>
