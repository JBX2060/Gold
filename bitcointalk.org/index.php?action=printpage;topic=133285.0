					Post by: <b>farlack</b> on <b>December 25, 2012, 06:16:48 PM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So here is whats going on, I bought a new laptop with windows 8, I transferred all my data onto an external hard drive, when I opened it up on W8 I had to load the blockchain again, and the UI looked odd. When everything loaded, everything was there except my coins, transaction names are there but nothing else.<br /><br />I thought it may be a failure of transfer from my hard drive so I plugged in my old hard drive to my new computer via external ports so W8 and W7 were hooked up at the same time, and the same results. The UI looks weird, so I plugged in my non-external hard drive to another computer that&#039;s the same model as my windows 7 while their hard drive was still loaded, and re downloaded the block chain off my W7 hard drive. The chain loaded, the saved transaction names loaded, no coins showed up.<br /><br />The persons who W7 computer I used also has bitcoin-qt installed they didn&#039;t have any coins in their account, but after the blockchain reloaded, and nothing showed up, I opened his bitcoin-qt, and my transaction names are saved under his client, and all coins are missing.<br /><br />What am I missing? I thought that having the data on the external was safe enough, had no paper backups, but somewhere something conflicted.<br />It was only 10 coins gone, but I&#039;m curious if anyone knows of a fix, or have had the same issue and can tell me if I&#039;m wasting time trying to get the coins.<br /><br />Let me know if I confused you with my explanation lol.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When I loaded my main hard drive as an external would that make it overwrite everything for my data and load the c drive files of the host computer? When I loaded my hard drive as an external it was like f and g drive.</div>
