					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Caerus Connections (https://www.caerusconnections.io (https://www.caerusconnections.io)) is a blockchain-based recruiting platform facilitating better employment matches worldwide by providing a service that creates a completely confidential process built on verifiable employment history resulting in saving time, money, and effort for both companies and candidates. Caerus is one of the first blockchain-based platform designed to disrupt the HR industry. <br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpwbtQFpIUs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpwbtQFpIUs)<br /><br />The developing Caerus Connections recruiting platform will use Caerus Token as its &#039;fuel&#039; and primary method of payment giving organizations the ability to search for qualified candidates and candidates the ability to showcase a complete and honest representation of their qualifications. This hiring ecosystem utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create a streamlined, safe and transparent environment. <br /><br />Initially sold at an equivalent of .0024 ETH per Caerus Token at the TGE (Token Generation Event), job seekers can use the platinum services of the recruiting platform for a subscription rate of 1 Caerus Token per month and corporate users at a rate of 3 Caerus Tokens per month. <br /><br />17 million tokens will be offered to the public in a TGE format. Early adopters can efficiently purchase using the smart contract with ETH or purchase BTC/LTC/USD for an additional transaction fee. &nbsp;<br /><br />13 million Caerus Tokens will be launched at a discounted rate in the pre-TGE that ends on March 31, 2018. Purchasers can receive their tokens within 24 hours of purchase.<br /><br />An additional 4 million Caerus Tokens will become available on April 1, 2018 in the official TGE until April 15, 2018 or until all available tokens are sold. <br /><br />The TGE will be considered a success when a minimum of 5,000 ETH is raised. Caerus is currently developing the Caerus Connections platform with a minimal viable product launch set for April 15, 2018. <br /><br />Following the TGE, 30 million retail Caerus Tokens will be available for purchase via the website. <br /><br />Summary:<br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Caerus Tokens is a utility token.<br /></li><li>Our development team includes individuals with extensive backgrounds in Human Resources, Recruitment, web development, blockchain technology and business management. </li><li>The platform will disrupt the HR industry by streamlining the recruitment and hiring process with blockchain technology.<br /></li><li>Initial token price of .0024 ETH per Caerus Token.<br /></li></ul>To read the full Caerus Connections whitepaper, visit: https://www.caerusconnections.io/#!/solution (https://www.caerusconnections.io/#!/solution) and click on &quot;Read PDF&quot;<br /><br />To get involved in the Pre-Sale Event, visit: https://www.caerusconnections.io/ (https://www.caerusconnections.io/)<br /><br />To become an early adopter and get involved in the Token Generation Event, visit: https://www.caerusconnections.io/caerus-tge/ (https://www.caerusconnections.io/caerus-tge/) <br /><br />Inquiries and questions?
