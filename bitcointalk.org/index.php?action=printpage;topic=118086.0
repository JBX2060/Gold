					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">cypherdoc,<br /><br />If you are not happy with the way I fulfill my responsibility to the administrator of this forum as a moderator you are more than welcome to post a complaint in this appropriate section of the forum. Also in case you didn&#039;t know this, I&#039;m not the only one moderating Bitcoin Discussions and I am not the only one receiving reports and if there is a dilemma, ultimately the forum administrator gets to decide how moderation is applied.<br /><br />All I do is what I promised the forum administrator I would do and I follow his guidelines to the letter. I&#039;m sorry if that doesn&#039;t make you happy, but then that isn&#039;t my problem, it&#039;s your problem with the forum administrator.<br /><br />So I ask you for the sake of keeping the section I moderate clean and for the sake of solving inefficiencies or moderator abuse as fast and as efficient as possible, please, in the future, present your complaints directly to the administrator instead of attacking me as an off topic reply to a random post of mine.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />hazek</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">cypherdoc,<br /><br />It is true, I did delete a few of your off topic posts, only because they were off topic and posted after I had already split the thread and moved your initial off topic posts and after I notified you about that with a PM. Unfortunately this forum doesn&#039;t, at least not to my knowledge, allow me to merge threads. If I could do that I would have split your posts from that original thread and moved them into this one. Since I couldn&#039;t and your posts were off topic, and I wasn&#039;t going to create new threads and move those, I opted to delete your posts.<br /><br />You are more than welcome to repost all of them here.<br /><br /><br />Best regards,<br />hazek<br /><br />p.s.: Moved posts are not censorship. Most issues have their appropriate sections of the forum, for example forum &amp; and moderator discussion belongs in Meta.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">cypherdoc, my opinion on the matter is the Bitcoin Foundation was a special case.<br /><br />Technically, the announcement of it belongs in Service Announcements/Discussion, yet it remains on the main forum. I think this inconsistency is tolerable given the significance of TBF. The community reacted strongly to it, in more than one way. So complaining about moderation inconsistency over that announcement is understandable, but I think a bit rigid.</div>

Moreover, you seem to ignore what censorship really means:<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient as determined by a government, media outlet, or other controlling body. It can be done by governments and private organizations or by individuals who engage in self-censorship.</div><br />I am very skeptical about Wikipedia, but the above quote shows that you are complaining over accepted moderation, not over censorship. By accepted moderation I mean the mutual agreement you accepted once you created an account in this forum. Do not forgot this forum is a private institution and as such it can moderate whatever it regards as necessary for its private matters.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118086.msg1270189#msg1270189">Quote from: cypherdoc on October 13, 2012, 08:21:01 PM</a></div><div class="quote">continuing to use the &quot;off topic&quot; excuse as a reason to banish my comments over here to the Meta forum is not helping your case but in fact illuminating your hypocrisy. </div><br />It appears you are making a special pleading.
