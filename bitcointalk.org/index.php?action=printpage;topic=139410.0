					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Right now, My 7970, ever since i cleaned it out with canned air, the fan has been having &quot;issues&quot; <br />I own a singlefan XFX7970 &quot;ghost&quot;, Replacement fans are a Huge cost, And are quite bulky.<br /><br />The fan spins normally, sounds fine, Reports accurate tachometer readings and functions alright.<br />However it is showing symptoms of what i think are &quot;hi im gonna stop spinning at any moment&quot;<br />It will spin (at say 85%[i never run it above 87%]) just fine for a little bit, Then start making a kindof... Fluttering/Grinding? noise, and slows down by 500-700rpm.<br />if i wait a little bit, MSIa will put more power to the fan to speed it up, This causes the grinding noise to continue untill the fan reaches about 90% (5% faster than before) but still spins at the same RPM untill it suddenly sounds like something has &quot;fell out&quot; of the fan blades (like a dust clump) and then the fan goes WHIRRR from the power increse, Revs up about 500rpm and then drops back to the Proper 85% speed, With the correct noise. About five minutes later the whole process happens again.<br /><br /><b>Fan spins normally-&gt;Bad noise-&gt;fan slows-&gt;More power is added-&gt;fan spins Harder-&gt;noise dissapears-&gt;Fan spins Faster-&gt;Power is reduced-&gt;Fan spins normally</b><br /><br />This is my main GPU, I use it for everyday life, gaming, mining etc.<br />Do i have it sent in for RMA and be GPULess for I dont know how long, And maybe even have the same card sent right back to me with a &quot;nothings wrong&quot; stamp<br />Do i try More Air?<br />What should i do? <br />The gpu is the most valuble thing that i own :( and i&#039;d rather not see it blowout, At the same time i dont want to lose two weeks of mining For Nothing.<br />And the canned air is what started the problem in the first place</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds like the bearing or bushing is going out.&nbsp; Some fans give access through the fan hub by peeling the sticker back.&nbsp; If you can get to the shaft that way, a drop or two of teflon lube <i>may</i> help.&nbsp; More likely, you&#039;ll need a new fan.<br /><br />The good news is that it sounds like XFX has really good warranty policies.&nbsp; You might want to contact them directly.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Really hard to say.&nbsp; If you are already planning to replace the card, I wouldn&#039;t touch it, at least not without having a chat with their tech support first.</div>
