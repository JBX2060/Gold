					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">excuse my ignorance if this has been covered before<br /><br />I have a couple of mined blocks in my wallet. &nbsp;I would like to pull just those out of the wallet to try and keep a couple of &#039;pure&#039; blocks offline for later use. &nbsp;I checked the transactions id and my bitcoind has not used any of the btc&#039;s in the block addy for any sends ...yet<br /><br />Is there a way to pull just those coins offline?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I believe Armory (it&#039;s an extension for the Bitcoin-QT client) will allow you to send specific coins.&nbsp; You can download it and then separate the random coins from the coins you want to keep.&nbsp; If Armory won&#039;t work for you I&#039;ve read the Electrum client will do the same thing.&nbsp; This should be easier than exporting private keys. :P</div>
