					Title: <b>bitcoind on a Mac (Snow Leopard)</b><br />
					Post by: <b>pixelglow</b> on <b>June 24, 2011, 02:31:14 PM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m trying to run bitcoind, the headless server version of the bitcoin client, on my Snow Leopard Mac (10.6).<br /><br />Couple of issues:<br /><br />1. In the standard install of 0.3.23, I can&#039;t see any bitcoind, only the Bitcoin.app client.<br />2. I tried running <i>bitcoin -server</i> using the executable embedded within Bitcoin.app, but it still opened up the application.<br />3. I tried compiling from source i.e. <i>make -f makefile.osx bitcoind</i> on the src directory, but it died after spitting out tons of errors. It looks like there&#039;s some dependencies on third-party libs in there. Could we have a list of libs to download in order to build bitcoind?<br />4. Or perhaps someone can point me to an official, prebuilt bitcoind binary. I really don&#039;t want to go down the MacPorts etc. route.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />G.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, running <i>bitcoin -server</i> seems to work well as a JSON RPC server, although it&#039;s disconcerting to see the GUI up as well.<br /><br />What happens if I want to run bitcoin in a UI-less context? E.g. as a daemon during system startup or through SSH to the box? Essentially I need to run bitcoind in a Mac server box (as opposed to say a Linux server box).<br /><br />I tried running <i>bitcoin -daemon</i> but that seems pretty broken at the moment. After a couple of seconds it dies with:<br /><br />The process has forked and you cannot use this CoreFoundation functionality safely. You MUST exec().<br />Break on __THE_PROCESS_HAS_FORKED_AND_YOU_CANNOT_USE_THIS_COREFOUNDATION_FUNCTIONALITY__<span style="width: 0; margin: 0 -0.6ex 0 -1px;"> </span>_YOU_MUST_EXEC__() to debug.<br /><br />Is there actually a distinct bitcoind and what&#039;s the difference between that and Bitcoin.app?<br /><br />Mac OS X daemons are generally run through launchd scripts and do not fork on their own. If you can point me to some source code and a Mac build environment, I can hack on it until it works and contribute the changes back.<br /><br />Cheers<br />G.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For closure:<br /><br />You <b>can</b> build a bitcoind (headless bitcoin) on a Mac. The build instructions are not with the usual binary distribution but you can grab them off the github repository for bitcoin. The minimal dependencies are: boost (from boost.org) and Berkeley DB (from the freshmeat.net project), you (apparently) can use libssl and libcrypto from the system.<br /><br />bitcoind appears to run undaemonized, so it should be suitable for a launchd script. But I haven&#039;t tested this configuration yet.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />G.</div>
