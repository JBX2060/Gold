					Title: <b>Bitcoin Global Road Map 2017-2028</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Al Ien</b> on <b>November 08, 2017, 08:03:51 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>Suggested topic is devoted to discussion of Global Road Map of Bitcoin <span class="BTC">BTC</span><br /></b><br /><br /><br /><i>Based on following factors (I-IV) suggested for discussion is the Bitcoin Global Road Map (V).</i><br /><br /><br />I Number of active bitcoin wallets <br /><br />According to Mr.Woo&#039;s http://woobull.com/woos-law-of-bitcoin-user-growth-bitcoins-adoption-curve/ (http://woobull.com/woos-law-of-bitcoin-user-growth-bitcoins-adoption-curve/) research, bitcoin users double every 12 months. Mr. Woo makes corrections (S curve) based on real world human behaviour. Here comes wild idea that algorythms, based on mathematics and Laws of Universe are already changing real world human behaviour. Through smartphones, computers and gadgets they force us to move quicker to live more intense lives. They change us, attuning human schedule to Rythms of Universe, hence increasing people&#039;s efficiency. <br /><br /><br /><br />II Halvings schedule (next is on June 12 2020) - recalculating of network difficulty<br /><br />The network started on January 3 2009. First halving took place in 2012 which led to all time high of more than $1000 in November 2013. So, after halving bitcoin price can increase 10 fold. After next halving in 2016 we witnessed the power of third wave of bitcoin evolution in November 2017, when bitcoin rocketed to $7,900 and peaked $12,400 in Zimbabwe.<br />After next halving, which means that emission of bitcoin slows down and miners will be rewarded only 6.25 bitcoins (now 12.5) for one mined block. Which increases the cost of every mined coin. Because of the limited coins supply increases the price.<br /><br /><br />III Achievements of past 9 years of bitcoin existence<br /><br />https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/ (https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/) 183 times Bitcoin could die. No other technology/product/startup is known that could survive under such huge pressure. That shows mathematical correctness of the protocol, flexibility and stability of Bitcoin Protocol. That means Bitcoin can evolutionate. It can change. Like a snake that gets rid of old skin, bitcoin is moving further, leaving its forks behind. Open to whole world&#039;s pressure, represented by banks, governments and financial institutions from outside and numerous challenges in form of soft and hard forks from inside, Bitcoin became capable to digest these pressures in the process of becoming holistic (i.e. indestructable) technology. <br /><br />The Bitcoin Technology (Protocol) is so advanced and multifaced (combined knowlegde from Game Theory, Economics, Programming, Finance, Cryptography, Quantum Mechanics) that still there are only a few people who completely understand this technology. Since the Bitcoin building is so huge, some people see only separate floors of this building. Some see financial implications. Some see social implications. Some see that this technology can change the world completely - there will be no need in banks, governments, Systems. Some see the future of the technology in VR and IOT. Some call it digital gold. Some - digital currency. Some - digital assets. Probably we see birth of new class of asset, to which quite another approach should be taken by regulators. It is nither currency nor goods. It is all together, all kinds of assets represented in one digital form.&nbsp; <br />The Technology is self-balancing, coming to dynamic equilibrium from any internal or external impulse, be it soft/hard forks or governmental pressure/attacks, between 4-5 parties, such as Developers, Wallets (People interacting with this technology), Finance (financial institutions, institutional investors), Miners and IoT in the future (yes, the Robots). Bitcoins can be traded 24x7, time moves 20 times faster in the world of Bitcoin, which can accelerate growth of human economics.<br /><br /><br /><br />IV Hello New World !!!!<br /><br />Bitcoin technology gives you freedom. Independence. But it also has another side of the coin - Responsibility. Personal. You are responsible for your money and if you were not conscious building cryptocurrency portofolio you can loose your funds. If you transfer to wrong address, you can&#039;t undo. No banks can help. No insurance company. You bear all the risks.<br />That increases awareness. That leads to forming many people making decision to take their Fate into their own hands. To be independent from the governments and banks. To have their own opinion how to live their lives. That means new way of living. No borders. Decentralised education, stimulating people to think independently to make decisions by themselves. Probably there will be merging of old (centralized) and new (decentralized) approaches in the world. Decentralization (New World) offers Competition to old centralized world, which can lead to mutual growth in the dance of Evolution. <br /><br /><br /><br />V Bitcoin Global Road Map<br /><br />---------------------------1 Birth of Bitcoin---------------------------<br /><br />2007&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bitcoin Design and Coding<br />2008&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; October - White paper published<br /><br />---------------------------2 Bitcoin&#039;s childhood------------------------<br /><br />2009 Year 1.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">till now all numbers given by Economics was wrong no one was think price will up to 7,900$ .<br /><br />if we back to 2016 all say bitcoin died and can’t move up till price up to 3,000$ then say it is bubble and now many say bitcoin is burn money and must open our virtual money (like Russia ).<br /><br />So any one say he can know bitcoin price is Lying Because it Depend on Simple Demand and Supply law .<br /><br />BTW great post and nice tracking&nbsp; ;D ;D </div>

I hope it all come through. It would be nice to have something like this coming directly from Core so we know exactly where bitcoin is going. Right now us ordinary folk know nothing about what&#039;s happening with development.</div>
