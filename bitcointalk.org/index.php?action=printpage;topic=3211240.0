					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div align="center"><div align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>RISE - An ecosystem for blockchain developers<br /></b></span></div> <br /><div align="center">RISE Website: https://rise.vision (https://rise.vision)<br />RISE Block Explorer: https://explorer.rise.vision/ (https://explorer.rise.vision/)<br />RISE Github: https://github.com/risevision (https://github.com/risevision)<br />RISE Roadmap: https://rise.vision/roadmap/ (https://rise.vision/roadmap/)<br />RISE Exchanges: https://rise.vision/exchanges/ (https://rise.vision/exchanges/)</div> <br />&nbsp;<br /><div align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>What is RISE?<br /></b></span></div> <br />RISE offers a platform for Decentralized Distributed Applications (DAPPs), powered by a community driven Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain. RISE enables developers to interact and build on the blockchain in multiple programming languages.<br />&nbsp;<br /><div align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Here&#039;s how it works<br /></b></span></div><br /><b>Decentralized Distributed Applications</b> - Applications built on RISE will be both distributed and decentralized, as a copy of the blockchain will reside on multiple nodes and if one node fails the network can still operate. Each DAPP created with RISE development tools will run on RISE side chain technology connecting to the main chain.<br /><br /><b>Developer Tools</b> - RISE aims to offer developers Software Development Kits (SDKs) to enable the creation of Decentralized Distributed Applications (DAPPs). Developers will also be able to interact with the RISE blockchain through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in multiple code languages such as TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, C# and Ruby. <br /><br /><b>Delegated Proof of Stake Blockchain</b> - RISE operates a DPOS network of RISE nodes, maintained by 101 Delegates nodes that are elected by the RISE community through voting with their RISE wallets. The vote weight of each wallet is in proportion to the amount of RISE it contains. The more RISE you have in your wallet, the more ‘voting power’ you have. Voting has a fee of 1 RISE and you can only vote for 1 Delegate per wallet. Elected active Delegates are rewarded for running nodes to secure the network. You can explore DPOS Tools here: https://dpostools.com/ (https://dpostools.com/)<br /><br /><b>TypeScript Code Base</b> - RISE is one of the first blockchain projects to have its core code base written in TypeScript. TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, developed and maintained by Microsoft, typically used for large web development projects. It enforces good coding standards, increases maintainability and helps to speed up future development of scalable projects. RISE core is in mainnet and source code can be found here: https://github.com/RiseVision/rise-node (https://github.com/RiseVision/rise-node)<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>RISE Social Network Sites<br /></b></span></div><div align="center">Twitter: @RiseVisionTeam or https://twitter.com/RiseVisionTeam?lang=en <br />Medium: https://medium.com/rise-vision<br />Telegram: https://t.me/risevisionofficial<br />Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/risevision/</div><br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi there<br /><br />When will you guys solve the problem of Exchanges? Our Investment are losing its Value day by day.<br /><br />Without a Proper Exchange no Tech. will be able to make RISE rise from the ashes.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t you guys concentrate on the major issue which is only Exchange Listing right now, Tech. could be taken care of later on.<br /><br />There are several Exchanges out there &amp; what makes me wonder is that you guys aren&#039;t even trying to get the RISE listed on any one of them since past 2 months &amp; more.<br /><br />Binance, HitBTC, Cryptopia, Coin Exchange, Livecoin &amp; many other tons of Exchanges are out there. <br /><br />Without a Proper Exchange how would you guys make RISE survive in these Land of Cryptos, only God knows?<br /><br />This situation is really getting worse &amp; frustrating day by day, so for God sake please do something &amp; get RISE listed on atleast 2-3 Exchanges asap.<br /><br />No one cares for the Tech. if we&#039;re not able to Trade it.<br /><br />I think till now you would have got my point. <br /><br />Awaiting to see RISE on atleast 2-3 Good Exchanges by next month.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The team have contacted various exchanges in the hope they will list RISE. There are many factors involved in the listing process, however we are confident with our new website, roadmap and TypeScript mainnet release that their decisions will have positive outcomes. <br /><br />In the meantime, RISE is currently available on <b>Openledger DEX, OctaEx, LesFex and Godex</b>. You may continuously check the exchanges page on our website for updates: <b>https://rise.vision/exchanges/</b><br /><br />For reference, please DO NOT use Yobit. After many attempts to contact them they have NOT cooperated to update wallets. </div>

I know that it is not free to get listed to those exchanges and some of them require significant amount of money but I think we can still be able to do that if the tries to gather money from the community. It will be a voluntary donation for its listing and if anyone is willing to donate money to it, that would really help this coin to move forward. I don&#039;t this is not a good idea and they should take a look into this. Just a suggestion.&nbsp; ;)</div>

We will restart the bounty program this week.&nbsp; <br />2. There will be a developer update soon on the new wallets. <br />3. Hopefully, we will be able to make an announcement on a new exchange this week for the near future. <br />4. Team will be getting together in June to discuss roadmap/strategy/development. <br />5. I am finalising a few events and meetups in June and July.<br />6. We are continuing partner conversations with potential partners in the UK &amp; Singapore and starting outreach to potential partners in South Africa and India.<br />7. Nearing completion of a pitch deck and overview doc.<br />8. A new marketing video is being worked on together with our creative partners, Darkroom. <br />9. I am actively trying to hire more developers to work on RISE.<br /><br />More information will come in the newsletter and along with a tech update.</div>

I thought I was being &#039;smart&#039; by buying the dip at 26 cents.... my stack is worth -75% now and that is if I am lucky enough to unload it on one of these no volume exchanges. In hindsight I should have sold during the pump that happened right before delisting, but I again thought I was being &#039;smart&#039;. :-\ :-\</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br /><br /><b>RISE Web Wallet Rewrite&#8202;—&#8202;Testers Wanted</b><br /><br />We have started the process of rewriting the RISE web wallet. Some of you have already heard about it from our newsletter, for others it will be the first time hearing about this. I want to quickly highlight some of the core team’s motivations and goals with this rewrite.<br /><br /><b>Why rewrite the Web Wallet?</b><br />We received feedback that highlighted the existing wallets were not user friendly and in some instances just stopped working due to legacy and unmaintained code. This is why recently we asked wallet users to use the web wallet only, as opposed to the desktop wallets. Given that a wallet is your access point to RISE that lives on the blockchain, it is highly important that the RISE web wallet is easy to use and reduces human error where possible. From an internal standpoint, the new wallet will also be written in TypeScript and this allows them to be easily maintained going forward. As the wallet will be written with React, it will be multiplatform reducing the need for extra resources to maintain different products.<br /><br />First and foremost, we want the RISE web wallet to provide a great experience everywhere, not just on desktop computers. The new wallet will be responsive and have enhanced user experience on desktop computers and mobile devices. Furthermore, the new web wallet will be a progressive web app, which means that you can add it to your home screen on mobile devices and it will behave as any other app you installed from AppStore™ or Google Play.<br /><br />We will also be adding hardware wallet support to the new web wallet. We want our users to have the option to store their RISE in the most secure way possible. Hardware wallets provide an extra level of security against computers or mobile devices that might have been infected with keyloggers or other malware.<br /><br />The rewrite will not only be about responsiveness and security, it will also focus on user-friendliness and accessibility. We want everyone to be able to easily create and manage their RISE accounts regardless of how technical or non-technical they are. To achieve that we will be running various user tests against prototypes to gather feedback and iterate to reach these goals.<br /><br /><b>How can you help?</b><br />We will be starting our first round of user testing soon, and we need your help! If you want to participate in the tests, please fill out the form in the Medium post below. <br /><br />https://medium.com/rise-vision/rise-web-wallet-rewrite-testers-wanted-d059d95d3ff1 (https://medium.com/rise-vision/rise-web-wallet-rewrite-testers-wanted-d059d95d3ff1)<br /><br />We look forward to sharing feedback with the community and creating an advanced crypto wallet for RISE.<br /><br />Thank you. <br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">CryptoNinjas.net - RISE v1.1.1 of DPoS Blockchain Technology Makes Significant Advancements:<br />https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/08/09/rise-v1-1-1-of-dpos-blockchain-technology-makes-significant-advancements/ (https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/08/09/rise-v1-1-1-of-dpos-blockchain-technology-makes-significant-advancements/)<br /><br />On August 8th 2018, RISE announced the release of their TypeScript core in version 1.1.1 to mainnet with innovative improvement to the DPOS blockchain technology. RISE is a platform for the development of DAPPs in popular web programming languages, powered by a community driven Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain. Read the technical overview here. <br /><br />In this latest core blockchain release, RISE has become a more desirable platform to build DAPPs on due to several features:<br /><br /><b>Transactions Per Second </b>- RISE core is now capable of handling up to 1000 transactions per second with a i7–7700 CPU. This will be a key feature that future DAPP developers will evaluate when choosing the technology for their DAPP. To compare, currently Ethereum can only process 15 Transactions per Second and Bitcoin can only process 7 Transactions per Second due to block size limit 1MB. <br /><br /><b>Data Integrity</b> - RISE has introduced atomic block processing for optimisation of the rollback procedure with blockchain data to restore integrity. RISE is the only DPOS blockchain forked from Crypti that features this functionality in mainnet. <br /><br /><b>Security</b> - RISE core now has three layers of security acting as firewalls to stop unintended and unwanted attacks on the blockchain. This was achieved with new logic and review of current static and logic validation mechanisms.<br /><br /><b>Code Quality</b> - RISE improved their code quality by upgrading from TypeScript 2.6 to 2.8, PostGres from 9.6 to 10 and moving away from pg-promise to sequelize. The codebase is now more concise, robust and easier to test and understand for web developers everywhere. <br /><br />In April this year, RISE released its rewritten core to mainnet in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Since then the core development team has grown and continued building the best technology for web developers to create blockchain applications in popular web languages and concepts. <br /><br />To date, the RISE DPOS protocol is unique with 101 block producers elected by RISE holders, who only have 1 vote per wallet. <br /><br />For more information or to join the community, visit the RISE website. You can also find RISE on the following social channels:<br />Github: https://github.com/risevision (https://github.com/risevision) <br />Twitter: https://twitter.com/RiseVisionTeam (https://twitter.com/RiseVisionTeam) (@RiseVisionTeam)<br />Telegram: https://t.me/risevisionofficial &nbsp;(https://t.me/risevisionofficial)<br />Medium: https://medium.com/rise-vision (https://medium.com/rise-vision)<br />Developer Slack: http://slack.rise.vision &nbsp;(http://slack.rise.vision)<br /></div>

Do you have any plan on being added to any other exchange out there? We are seeing some positive price movement now with Rise (which is a very good thing for this coin) but it would really help if we can get added to another exchange. One exchange that I can recommend is CryptoBridge. Their user base is increasing in the past few months and they&#039;re gaining some attention from the cryptocommunity. That will help this coin get introduced to those new investors that just got in and don&#039;t know anything about Rise.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">alty [7:18 PM]<br />Hi guys, after our team discussions yesterday we focused on three main elements. 1) Exchange listing and esp at least one major exchange. 2) Getting a finished and polished product. 3) A marketing plan so we can be heard with a clear direction of what makes our platform interesting. We have to get the message out about our project!! The team feels we have one shot to get this right as we move away from crypto winter and into a more positive market. For my part I will be contacting as many exchanges as possible on a regular basis. Frank will be working with me on our marketing plan and Veke will continue heading development. The three elements have to come together in unison. That is the teams priorities for now, I will keep you all updated on our progress on a regular basis. Have a good weekend!!</div>

As announced before, Bittrex is taking the Rise exchange wallet offline on April 12th. We asked for more clarity surrounding the fate of the Rise tokens that were left on the exchange by their rightful owners. Bittrex provided us with the following answer: The Rise tokens won&#039;t be dumped on the market but will be stored offline. If Rise ever gets relisted these tokens will become accessible again in the owner&#039;s accounts.<br /><br />In light of this new information from Bittrex, we believe the best course of action is to NOT release a new core version that would prevent moving the Rise tokens currently residing in the exchange wallet. It is in the best interest of the Rise token owners to maintain the possibility to potentially regain access to their Rise tokens in the future. Bittrex will secure and hold the tokens for their customers until then.<br /><br />We would like to thank everyone who participated in the voting process regarding this topic. Know that your vote was not in vain because it demonstrated we still have an active community and you are an important part of it.</div><br />https://vote.rise.vision/</div>
