					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have made a few transactions with my blockchain.info wallet and I am not getting the email notifications.<br /><br />I have confirmed my email and the settings are correct:<br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/RAJsL.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/RAJsL.jpg</a><br /><br />I&#039;m gonna try setting it to email me after 1 confirmation to see if that works instead.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">no--i checked that several times. &nbsp;blockchain.info email does not go to my spambox anyway. &nbsp;i have received email from them before.<br /><br />i tried SMS notifications, which also didn&#039;t work. &nbsp;which is weird cuz blockchain DOES send me texts as part of 2 factor authentication when i login.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Notifications will no longer be sent for SatoshiDICE transactions or any transactions involving addresses on this page http://blockchain.info/popular-addresses. This is to help reduce increasing costs of SMS messages.<br /><br />If the transactions do not involve popular addresses then I am not sure what the problem is. Perhaps you have reached the daily notifications limit?<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m seeing the same thing... it happened when I created some new addresses to track my various mining pools separately.<br />I&#039;m still getting notifications for older addresses, but newer ones I recently created get no notification emails for sent nor received transactions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve reset my email and notifications settings on the site, hoping this will fix the issue.&nbsp; I&#039;ll find out on the next block payment from one of the newer pools I added.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just because OP posted this issue two years ago doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not happening again.<br /><br />I&#039;m seeing it only occur with new addresses I&#039;ve created in the last few days.&nbsp; Older addresses trigger notification emails no problem, but any new transactions involving my new addresses are not triggering an email notification.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I created a blockchain.info wallet one year ago in April 2013.&nbsp; I have my settings configured to provide email notification upon sending or receiving BTC, just like OP&#039;s screenshot.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had 16 transactions sending and receiving BTC and not once have I received an email notification.&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />My email address is confirmed, I&#039;ve checked my spam folder, I&#039;ve tried switching from @yahoo.com to @gmail.com address.&nbsp; I&#039;ve submitted a support ticket, to which there has been no reply for 1 month.&nbsp; <br /><br />Multiple people are experiencing this issue and there seems to be no effort by blockchain.info to fix it.<br /><br /><b>It&#039;s concerning because if this settings isn&#039;t working, then what other settings are not working?</b>&nbsp; If I tick the box to restrict the login to my IP address or to prevent login from the torr network, I fear that those settings may not be functioning properly either and my BTC is not secure on this service.&nbsp; :(<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Add me to the list of people not getting an email notification. I turned it on yesterday and since then two transactions have occurred and 0 notifications. I do instantly get my wallet emailed to me every time it changes (new address, etc) and my email address is confirmed.</div>
