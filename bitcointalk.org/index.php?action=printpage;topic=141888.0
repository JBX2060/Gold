					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just discovered that some old transactions do not displayed the same way:<br /><br />In my bitcoin client 7.0 beta, the transaction I sent out is an integer, for example 40<br />But in blockchain.info, same transaction include 2 transactions, besides the original transaction, there is another one charging the transaction fee:<br /><br />xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&nbsp; 0.55126951 BTC<br />yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40 BTC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-40.49513626 BTC<br /><br />The transaction towards xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx in the above case did not get recorded in my QT client, so client recorded only -40 BTC spending,&nbsp; but the blockchain.info recorded -40.49513626 BTC, which is not the total of these 2 transactions either, very confusing...<br /><br />The result is that my QT client showed a higher total balance than the blockchain.info for a certain address<br /><br />currently I&#039;m not able to check this out in blockexplorer.com (seems search function dead), so I have no other more authoritive info</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bitcoin &quot;the wallet&quot; has many addresses that are yours (and are not show to you if it is a reserve or change address), which all add up to your balance. Other people&#039;s Bitcoins, or web services, can&#039;t know your balance because they don&#039;t know what addresses belong to you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As grue and deepceleron have explained, this is probably &quot;change&quot; from your transaction.&nbsp; Here is a more detailed explanation:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140639.msg1497321#msg1497321">Quote from: DannyHamilton on February 02, 2013, 05:12:24 AM</a></div><div class="quote">With the way bitcoin works, you can&#039;t partially spend a previous output that you received.&nbsp; It has to be completely spent.&nbsp; So, if you receive 10 BTC all in a single transaction from someone/somewhere at an address, then that address now has a single 10 BTC output.<br /><br />Later if you want to send 2 BTC to somebody, the program can use the previous 10 BTC output as an input into the transaction, and create a 2 BTC output to the address where you want to send it.&nbsp; This leaves 8 BTC leftover in the transaction.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t send those 8 BTC somewhere, then they become miner fees and end up in the coinbase transaction of the new block for the miner to keep.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to give those 8 BTC away as fees to the miner, then you need to include a second output in your transaction sending the 8 BTC back to your own wallet.&nbsp; As an analogy, think of pulling a $10 bill out of your pocket to pay for something that costs $2, you get $8 back in &quot;change&quot;.<br /><br />The way Bitcoin-Qt does this is to create a new bitcoin address that it doesn&#039;t tell you about and keep track of that address and the associated private key in your wallet.dat.&nbsp; Since this isn&#039;t an address that you requested in the &quot;Receive Coins&quot; tab of the user interface, it doesn&#039;t show up in that list.&nbsp; Bitcoin-Qt knows about the address since it is in the wallet.dat file, so it includes it in the balance that it shows you.&nbsp; Bitcoin-Qt uses a new change address for every transaction.&nbsp; So if you create 10 different transactions, each sending bitcoins somewhere, then your wallet will have used 10 different change addresses (although some of them may be empty if Bitcoin-Qt used the bitcoins associated with some of those address as inputs into other transactions).<br /></div></div>
