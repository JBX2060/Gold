					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I downloaded the gpg4win 2.1.0 from gpg4win.org Using the GPA program that came with it I generated a key by using a name and email address and a pass phrase like it asked for and it created the key.<br /><br />Now I have no idea how to use this key to encrypt my sent messages<br /><br />I have no idea how to find the public key to give to other to decrypt my messages.<br /><br />I have no idea how to add other peoples public keys to decrypt their messages either and if I had the key I wouldn&#039;t know the steps to decrypting it.<br /><br />Can someone help me? I am totally lost on this subject and I&#039;ve read a lot.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You probably should move this to technical support.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Concept</span><br />You have a keypair (public &amp; private key). &nbsp;You don&#039;t use YOUR public key to encrypt messages to other people. &nbsp;Only the person with the matching private key can decrypt the message. &nbsp;So if encrypted with YOUR public key only YOUR private key can decrypt it. &nbsp;You need the public key or the person you want to send the message to. &nbsp;You encrypt it with THEIR public key and then only THEIR private key can decrypt it.<br /><br />To sign a message &nbsp;---&gt; You SIGN the message with YOUR PRIVATE KEY.<br />To verify a message &nbsp;---&gt; You VERIFY the message with the SENDER&#039;S PUBLIC KEY (it could only be signed by their private key if valid)<br />To encrypt a message ---&gt; You ENCRYPT the message with the RECIPIENTS PUBLIC KEY (can only be decrypted by someone with the matching private key)<br />To decrypt a message ---&gt; You DECRYPT the message with YOUR PRIVATE KEY<br /><br />Make sense?<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To export your public key using GPG4Win</span><br />In GPG4Win to export your public key (remember never share your private key with ANYONE) right click on your key.<br />Select EXPORT KEY. &nbsp;<br />Save it as a file (name doesn&#039;t matter just remember where it is).<br />Now open that file you saved in a text editor (like notepad).<br /><br />You will see something like this (but probably longer):<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: SKS 1.1.0<br /><br />BS7/Qvu2x6akhlfwWhD1+b4SiLwU7ERKhH09bhvvpn/1FuE2GNgeBhwz3zK1MqeFDpMIHCwO<br />Gn6vy0PDgS227G0bqldeYMqYyVgPS/I6xD3V4HhFi7SHvCVJ78/suDmVUyeOLulQyWgH37Bw<br />dg4b5970Z7oOJi+okcQwt2HPpy4mcIcJqyFza6GC/Dyhk6TScZYXdoaQnytcX+qVPTEVqFqx<br />64pm0OnyuS+hygeLIbAwkhf65HrgI0C8b8SnvgqYP3AyzUJh8gRdwZxYnDxc4jP+AzEMZ29T<br />35eDrTUiFMu1a/tCn/KI2eGXKK970xBh8kR1W1/JK//dwUpQIKgn/fivnsdejhiAIFgX+LJk<br />2aOl24YCl+T239p6eVIHEMPUNM43cNo8umyETwHxLYibaNIFR2eX9LsUtObJJL5Aw2YIgUj4<br />nM2v5sjiUEzxctd4UklJLfqdbe38cFZnhFz2JdQ5h4ZSAdoGQAGkg0rqrMr3AhykQiRTt5w4<br />k6ad6HRklrma6kYNBD6UahqOTUrBTlx2cN7MQfAON/ljc8cEUQdAHcVB316LoBJpHluLLTpX<br />9hp61F2RzYO1TlHfpVc=<br />=hFYB<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</div><br />You can send your public key to a recipient (even include it inside an encrypted message) and they can use it verify your signatures and send you encrypted files.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Import another person&#039;s public key using GPG4Win</span><br />If the person provides the key as a text KEY BLOCK (as above) use a text editor and save it as a text file (notepad, ultra edit, notepad++).<br />In GPA4Win click on the [Keys] menu and select [Import Key].<br />Select the file you saved the public key in and click [Ok].<br /><br />The key should now be listed in your key manager.<br />You can use it to verify signatures from this person and to send encrypted messages to this person.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Servers</span><br />Alternatively you can upload your key to keyserver (but that is a little more advanced).<br />For example here is Tangible Cryptography public key<br />http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x28BB715FC26C17CD<br /><br />You can also search keyservers to find other entities public keys:<br />http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/<br /><br />For example search for TangibleCryptography. &nbsp;Now be careful it is possible for someone to upload a fake key pretending to be someone else.<br />The person who you are communicating with should be able to provide you their key signature via off-band method.<br /><br />Tangible Cryptography LLC key signature is <b>28BB715FC26C17CD</b>. &nbsp;If you see any other TangibleCryptography it is a fake.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">well you linked me to a site that says use thunderbird and enigma extension. You download thunderbird and then goto enigma site and the plugin for the latest version which is the only version you can download on thunderbirds main page only has a beta version for macosx. The enigma extension for thunderbird 15 on windows does not exist. Therefore the guide you sent me was out of date and useless to me. That&#039;s the brutal truth.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You must feel really frustrated, and i&#039;m sorry for that.<br /><br />I&#039;ve felt frustrated like that before, links being 404 or otherwise not the correct version.<br /><br />But you know, I&#039;ve found that with any dated tutorial some digging is required to get the correct versions (of whatever) to make everything work correctly.</div>
