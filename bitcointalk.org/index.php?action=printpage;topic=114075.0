					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got mine from 9mart. 2 16x riser cables for $9 and free shipping. Only caveats are:<br /><br />1) You don&#039;t know if they&#039;ll ship from the US warehouse or overseas.<br />2) QA is kind of dodgy. To their credit they did replace a defective cable with no hassle after I sent them a picture of it.<br /><br />They&#039;ve been running on my 6 gpu mining rig since Feb with zero problems.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This sucks! I have some equipment on its way and cant find these damned powered risers in Canada. Can anyone point me in the right direction?<br /><br />I think I may have to order them from China and wait a month. I noticed they are making them with capacitors now as well.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I found them here, these guys are out of BC. http://www.hashratestore.com/<br /><br /><br /></div>
