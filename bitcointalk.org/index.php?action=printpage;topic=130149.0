					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I already use a Yubikey that I bought in order to have a 2 factor with lastpass and blockchain.info.&nbsp; Is there a way to use the same key with Mt Gox?&nbsp; <br /><br />When I get to the &quot;Add new software Authentication System&quot; I get a &quot;standard private key&#039; and a &quot;secure private key&quot; and a blank field called &quot;code&quot;.&nbsp; Do I need to use the Yubikey personalization software to generate the code?<br /><br />I do not want to use google authenticator, and I don&#039;t want to have to buy Mt. Gox&#039;s yubi key.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks</div>

Gox, just like you would configure Google Authenticator.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- http://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/personalization-tools/yubikey-otp/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No you cannot use an existing YubiKey with Mt Gox.&nbsp; I thought the same.&nbsp; You have to order a YubiKey from them for their site.<br /><br />That&#039;s their policy.&nbsp; there is no technical reason why, except they want to make a few extra bucks off the process, I guess.<br /><br />They program to OTP into the key.&nbsp; The first profile is for log in on to their system, the second profile is used for transferring money from your account.<br /><br />While it is a pain, it is advisable to go ahead and get one.&nbsp; When I did, I got the one that was branded with the Mt Gox logo.&nbsp; Makes it easier to manage.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This leads me to think:<br /><br />If I bought a Yubikey for Mt Gox (first) could I then also use it later with a Blockchain.info wallet?<br /><br /></div>

I don&#039;t think it makes much sense but that&#039;s the technical reason they advertise.</div>

If your yubikey is keylogged, it can actually be re-used by an attacker due to the way BC.info decided to support Yubikeys (the wrong way).</div>
