					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It didn&#039;t blow up but it crashed, now only two cards will show up. All cards have been tested and work fine mining... I can get two cards to mine on this board no problem, <br /><br /><br />This thing was working fine hours ago.... Has anyone had this problem where connected cards wont show up? <br /><br />I am running winblows 7 64bit.. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It sounds like your hardware failed. :-\&nbsp; You should test different configurations (card slots and power cables) to determine where the problem is.&nbsp; You may have to replace the motherboard or power supply. :-[</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve had problems like this 3 times in the past. I don&#039;t miss my GPU days.<br /><br />The only thing that fixed it was unseating all of the cards but one, starting and letting windows see that configuration, then shutting down, reseating the cards, and starting again. It&#039;s a pain in the ass because of the PCI plastic thingy that keeps the card in place. A popsicle stick worked best for me.<br /><br />Fuckin&#039; windows.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">All the cards fan&#039;s spin. I am lost here. Maybe a dummy plug would help.. I am going to try that... but i never needed them before.... drivers are the same... <br /><br />Going to go screw around with it .... </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">could be just the riser is bad, I think that is what shorted out one of my boards. the connection where the cables run into the hard place got kinked and arc off on the board. BAD, VERY BAD! that is why I just ordered more riser cables, freakin 3 dollar part smoked a 125 dollar motherboard! LOL</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The risers were not being used.... I gave up on them.. <br /><br />The board is being RMA&#039;d with MSI... I shipped them the board overnight... they shipped out a new board. I will have it monday..... <br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup.. got a new board works perfect... 2 days later another identical board did the exact same thing running different hardware..... <br /><br /><br />They sent me out another replacement board I should receive it tomorrow. <br /><br /><br />I think it has something to do with not enough power going to the PCI-E lanes.. MSI wont give me any straight answers but in their defense they do have very good &quot;FAST&quot; customer service... ( it does help that I live about 3 hours away from their Canadian service center. <br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m running 5 cards on this same exact motherboard which has been mining for 8+ months, no such failure has happened to me yet. My AX1200 psu did fail during that time, but the motherboard has been solid. How long were you mining on it before it failed?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a few of these.. I have noticed only my revision 1.1 boards have started to give me issues. <br /><br />My other rev 1.3 boards are fine. Have been mining strong for months... <br /><br /><br />The boards have been mining for well over a year... <br /><br /><br />Has anyone had any issues with their rev 1.1 boards? <br /><br /><br /><br />No my GPU&#039;s are not MSI.. I may have a couple MSI 5850/5870&#039;s in the mix but mostly sapphire.</div>
