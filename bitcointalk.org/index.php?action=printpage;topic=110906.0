					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Today I was attempting to get my wife set up in the world of Bitcoin, so I set up a wallet for her on blockchain.info and she sent 2 BTC to her wallet from her Satoshi Client. I also set her up with KeePass on her Mac, so that she could start to save her passwords in an organized manner. Well, somewhere along the way we created a key file that doesn&#039;t work. Of course, we only find out it doesn&#039;t work after we&#039;ve closed the program and along with it the password to her blockchain wallet. Needless to say, she&#039;s spoiled on bitcoin and password managers.&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />I&#039;m fricking pissed because I can open up the key file and it contains a string of text. It looks like the keyfile is perfectly fine, but we keep getting a corrupted message every time we try to open the database. $#@*&amp;@#$*&amp; @$*@&amp;*@&#38;#*#@# @#@@##@ $*@&amp;$@*&amp;@$!!@!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The KeePass forum blows and don&#039;t expect to get any help there. If anybody here can help it would be awesome.<br /><br />BTW, the key file we created was a brand new generated file. I don&#039;t see how it could have gotten corrupted. *sigh*</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">WHEW!!!!!!!<br /><br />My wife fixed it! It seems KeePass doesn&#039;t like filenames with SPACES in them. And to think of those poor little Bitcoins that would have been lost if that stupid little technically didn&#039;t get discovered!</div>
