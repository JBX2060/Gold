					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Unconfirmed just means that it hasn&#039;t been written to stone in the blockchain yet.&nbsp; It&#039;ll get there eventually.&nbsp; You haven&#039;t lost anything if you see an unconfirmed transaction at blockchain.info - it just means that it hasn&#039;t been processed yet (effectively).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A score is calculated to determine how &#039;important&#039; your transaction is. &nbsp;More coins are more important. &nbsp;Older coins are more important. &nbsp;Paying the transaction fee makes them more important. &nbsp;Then the highest scoring TXs get batched up and included in the next block.&nbsp; If that block fills up, the lower scoring transactions stick around and need to go in a later block.<br /><br />In this case one transaction probably had a lower score for some reason, and takes a while to get the first transaction.<br /><br />Not sure what you&#039;re doing, but eventually that transaction will hit the right threshold and go through. &nbsp;So you&#039;ll have paid twice. &nbsp;Since I don&#039;t know the details, I&#039;m not sure if you can get someone to send one payment back.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks that&#039;s comforting to know.&nbsp; I had the same question after waiting<br />about an hour for the first confirmation on a transaction.<br />As an added bonus my coins came in while I was reading this thread!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Makes one wonder if it will ever be possible to pay a $5 coffee with bitcoin, if it takes hours to get confirmed. <br /><br />Unless one pays a hefty % premium for transaction fees to speed it through.</div>
