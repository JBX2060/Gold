					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi,<br /><br />This is an issue that is plaguing me since months, and I&#039;d like to ask if there is any solution to it.<br /><br />Often, when I try to send a large amount of BTC, I get the following message:<br />error: {&quot;code&quot;:-4,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Error: Transaction creation failed&nbsp; &quot;}<br /><br />If this error happens, I try sending a smaller amount.&nbsp; Eventually this succeeds.&nbsp; There is always a treshold below which the transaction can be created successfully.&nbsp; However the treshold is not a static value, but rather depends on some internal details of my wallet.&nbsp; Sometimes the treshold is lower than 1 BTC, sometimes it is near 200 BTC.&nbsp; After each successful send, the treshold jumps a different value (higher or lower).&nbsp; I cannot send more than 200 BTC ever anymore since the problem started to appear, and it becomes worse and worse with time.<br /><br />After googling this forum and other sites, my understanding is that the error occurs because the transaction becomes too complex.&nbsp; The source of it seems to be &quot;wallet pollution&quot; where many small inputs exist and bitcoind wants to combine too many of them into the transaction.<br /><br />My wallet file is 2.3 MB, and certainly there may be many small items in it.&nbsp; However there are also plenty of large items that could be used to form the desired transaction (without reaching the excessive complexity).&nbsp; Bitcoind seems to use a poor strategy in choosing the inputs from the available ones.<br /><br />The problem appears accross many versions of bitcoin, including v0.3.x and v0.6.3, and on several machines.&nbsp; It never appears on a fresh install, only starts to appear after the wallet has grown a lot, and then becomes worse with time.<br /><br />My questions:<br /><br />1. Do I have some way to influence which inputs are chosen?&nbsp; For example, can I choose 10 &quot;virgin&quot; coins for a 500 BTC transaction, instead of thousands of 0.01xxx inputs?<br /><br />2. Can I somehow view the details of my wallet?&nbsp; I imagine that I could send the offending small inputs away to a different wallet, if I only knew their exact face value and the order in which they appear in the wallet.<br /><br />3. Is there any other way to &quot;clean&quot; my wallet, or reorder the items in it so that the offending items will be selected last instead of first?<br /><br />I am living with the problem, but it gets worse and worse every week.&nbsp; I cannot ignore it much longer.&nbsp; Right now I am thinking about this resolution strategy:&nbsp; Fresh install on a new box.&nbsp; Try to send 99.9 BTC to the new box.&nbsp; If fails, decrease the amount by 0.1 BTC and retry (until success). Start over with 99.9.&nbsp; Continue until the wallet is empty or near empty.&nbsp; Delete the remaining wallet file.&nbsp; Obviously this method is costly because of the TX fees involved.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a similar issue, and I don&#039;t think it is a transaction complexity problem.&nbsp; I have an address with a single transaction that I cannot send coins from.&nbsp; <br />In my case, I have a block reward from solo mining that caused my Bitcoin client to crash in May, when I first tried to spend it.&nbsp; Shortly afterward, the client would crash or close every time it tried to open the wallet.&nbsp; I used pywallet to extract the private keys for that address and other addresses with coins.&nbsp; I was successful in importing the private keys and spending coins from all other addresses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s what is strange.&nbsp; If I import the private key in a unencrypted wallet, the Bitcoin client crashes when it tries to open the wallet.&nbsp; If I import the private key in an encrypted wallet, the Bitcoin client shows the 50.xxx coins in the wallet.&nbsp; However, if I try to send them, I get &quot;Transaction creation failed&quot;.&nbsp; I have also tried several releases (from 0.3x to 0.7RC1) with no luck.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard there is an issue with some addresses created on earlier clients and encrypted with newer client releases.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t hear back from Gavin (he&#039;s excused if he&#039;s been busy :))&nbsp; &nbsp;I think I&#039;ll ping him again to clarify if there is a known issue.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Jetmine, how old is the wallet?&nbsp; Do you know the client version it was created with?&nbsp; Did you encrypt it with a later client?<br /><br />I think your best bet is to use pywallet to extract the keys for addresses with coins.&nbsp; I&#039;d import them into a new wallet one address at a time and send them, to make sure you don&#039;t have a bad key or address.&nbsp; If you try it, keep us posted...</div>
