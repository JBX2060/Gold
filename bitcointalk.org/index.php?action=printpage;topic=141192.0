					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So I&#039;m working on a project that will hold bitcoins and of course, security is the most obvious risk/danger. <br /><br />On advice of the developer we have a specially compiled version of bitcoind (unnecessary RPC calls have been removed, as well as calls that pose a security risk). <br /><br />Bitcoind runs under a separate user than the php script. SSH/ftp into the server is only possible with keyfiles. <br /><br />All mysql calls are escaped so injection should (hopefully) be covered. <br /><br />A cold wallet is being implemented so the majority of funds are off-site. <br /><br />What other steps should I be keeping in mind? After some advice from a friend I&#039;m worried as well about somehow the database being compromised in some slight way as to affect imperceptible shifts in balances that I would be unable to detect.<br /><br />I toyed with the idea of every database entry having a hash generated from all the data and the hash being periodically verified against the database to check for manipulation. But is this realistic? <br /><br />Anyone have any more ideas? Thank you</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">With the admin tool you can make any changes you want to the database and it cannot be detected, also corruption<br />better to encrypt certain fields in the database<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Agreed that if you are storing information that is sensitive (such as email addresses or other more personal information) then it should be encrypted.<br /><br />If you need to *index* any such columns then this will make things trickier (although you could create another column for indexing purposes that contains the first x characters provided that isn&#039;t going to be a problem application-wise).<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sensitive information, like email is encrypted and salted. The admin tools are locked to IP addresses as well, although their powers are limited in scope. Users can choose to use Google Authenticator as well. <br /><br />Anything else? I&#039;m sure there must be lots of things I&#039;m overlooking! </div>

Choose a strong password for the RPC calls, listen only on the local interface and add some iptables rules on top of it just to be sure. MUCH more secure. If you keep the &quot;send&quot; calls disabling other calls is pointless.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yes this is extreme. Additional layers of security can be added with growth of value.<br /><br />But we&#039;ve seen it all in bitcoin.<br /><br />Compromised hosts<br /><br />exposed public keys<br /><br />unpatched zero day exploit<br /><br />trojans<br /><br />disappearing data that was not backed up.<br /><br />insider fraud.<br /><br />If you are dealing with anything of value exposed though an http interface you are vulnerable.<br /><br />You can never be too safe.</div>

SSH/ftp into the server is only possible with keyfiles. <br /><br />All mysql calls are escaped so injection should (hopefully) be covered. <br /><br />A cold wallet is being implemented so the majority of funds are off-site. <br /><br />What other steps should I be keeping in mind? After some advice from a friend I&#039;m worried as well about somehow the database being compromised in some slight way as to affect imperceptible shifts in balances that I would be unable to detect.<br /><br />I toyed with the idea of every database entry having a hash generated from all the data and the hash being periodically verified against the database to check for manipulation. But is this realistic? <br /><br />Anyone have any more ideas? Thank you<br /></div><br />I am surprised that such an engine hasn&#039;t been developed for commercial websites yet...</div>

No handcrafted SQL queries. All your parameters are sent as binary (or escaped automatically in some libs) and there is no need to escape.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What do people think about this service: <br /><br />http://www.dome9.com/<br /><br />If I am hosting on Amazon Ec2, they can use the API to shut off all the ports all the time, except for when you plan to login. It seems like a nice solution to shut down any open ports, additionally as I have a developer working with me, it allows me to at a later point keep an eye on when they are on the server as well, no? <br /><br /></div>

Why would you need to know when they log on to the server?<br /></div><br />Well although I trust my developer, I might in the future have additional developers- or even the developer could be compromised in some way I can&#039;t know. It seems to make more sense to say, okay can we do this? I&#039;ll open the server for this day for updates/fixes, and then have it close again after. I don&#039;t have to wonder if the developer/s log back in at a different time after the fix has been done. I know I can close things myself, but I&#039;m a novice. I&#039;d rather know I haven&#039;t overlooked something. </div>
