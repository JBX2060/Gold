					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Announcing the Crypto Gambling Foundation (http://cryptogambling.org)<br /><br />The Crypto Gaming Foundation is going to be setting a standard for transparency and fairness in our gaming community. Online casinos are amongst the least trusted businesses in the world with only 34% (http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/survey-data/Gambling-participation-in-2016-behaviour-awareness-and-attitudes.pdf) of people believing that online gambling is fair and can be trusted. <br /><br />Personally, I remember when this community was much smaller and websites with poor fairness and dishonest practices were shunned. It worries me that crypto gambling is becoming more and more similar to real money gambling with some of the top crypto casinos regularly taking advantage of players with abusive practices. <br /><br />Because of this I am happy to join and help this group encourage fair gambling in this space. Check it out, browse our articles and join the forum. Membership is of course free. &nbsp;<br /><br />Main Site: http://cryptogambling.org &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Forum: http://forum.cryptogambling.org/<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://image.ibb.co/kwH4m5/Artboard_140.png">https://image.ibb.co/kwH4m5/Artboard_140.png</a> (http://cryptogambling.org)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The only slight self promotion that will be supported is that of all BTC/Crypto sites. They will in turn end up profiting money as more flows into our industry. Non provably fair sites will definitely take a hit as traction is built and vice versa. <br /><br />This is an awesome technology which has been neglected for far too long honestly. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So this is more or less like an Open Better Business Bureau type of setup ?<br /><br />Where the most trusted sites join and if they are competent they get to show the logo and gamblers can go to your site to confirm that the site is being fair and compliant.<br /><br />I can see this working, especially if its non-profit only. Not where you require a payment to get to list a site and the site gets to display your logo.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This sound like a good news for cryptogambling world: something has to be done to clear bitcoin (and cryptos in general) reputation. Most of non bitcoiners still associate BTC to shady business and this is a step in the right direction to show those people they are wrong nowadays.</div>

Since you would need a quantum computer and even if you had one you might as well might some Bitcoins instead.<br /><br />But there are bugs sometimes, I remember there was an ETH dice site that had a bug and its unhashed seed was leaked. Luckily the admin caught it because the gambler apparently had way too many wins in a row and it didn&#039;t look like a coincidence.<br /><br />Like you said, its possible they can do this but its very difficult to predict gambling behaviour and the gambler might discover they are being targetted and just do the opposite and win instead.</div>

And either some whale or some bad streak can easily cause the site to become insolvent.<br /><br /></div>Everyone has his religion! Some claim provably fair is important, others claim that the site must provide how much capital it has and based on my experience I claim that there need to be a fund where money goes in to enforce claims of victims. In some cases there is nothing you can do, but in most cases victims could initiate legal action, but they never heard the word court and or are not willing to spend a small percentage!<br /></div><br />Why bother with court cases etc. when a site can be fully transparent with its dealings/bets &amp; in return risk its reputation without it having to be proven in court?<br /></div>The court cases are not to proof that it was not provably fair. The court cases are to enforce account balances or claims, as there are gambling operators that simply embezzle (https://game-protect.com/online-gaming-embezzlement/) the hole balances of all customers at one point or selectively close accounts with false accusations.<br /><br />The gambling sites who scam do not care about their reputation and they find enough victims that are not aware about their scam tactics!<br /></div><br />I understand this is what we&#039;re trying to avoid. We&#039;re discussing taking any losses players may have from CGF approved websites and refunding them (Investment sites not included)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would like to say that this is getting good! The crypto gambling foundation is getting traction, I saw that the logo of CGF was used on bustadice. Good to see that some gambling sites are support this movement. Maybe one day CGF would be a centralized body that would not really control the gambling industry but more of just to enforce fair play with everybody.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For me, the most important thing when it comes to online casinos is that I can verify my bets, to make sure that casino is not cheating in some way. I support you guys 100% and I&#039;m really looking forward to it. <br /><br />P.S.<br />A lot of players don&#039;t really know what &quot;provably fair&quot; really means.

Almost every site has some form of provably fair technology for verifying bets.<br /><br />I think what sites need to do however is have some form of similiar provably fair software. Because some sites do it differently than others. For example some sites always give you a new client seed for every roll, some sites only do it per session. <br /><br />This is fine however but it makes it very difficult for a new person to verify the bets if they aren&#039;t used to the basic standard.<br /><br />For example look at www.megadice.com, they give you a provably fair seed, but we have no idea how to verify it</div>

Provably is barely even a word in my opinion. <br /></div><br />I think &quot;verifiable fairness&quot;, is the most descriptive. But the term &quot;provably fair&quot; is so well established that I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much upside in rebranding it. <br /></div><br />Yeah, it has been thrown around in almost every casino I&#039;ve been since I started gambling with cryptocurrencies. However, I would agree with oracleongoodbye here (though not about the word &quot;provably&quot; since I can&#039;t really find any truth that it is not a word because from a quick google search it almost always comes up in dictionaries that it is an adverb of the word &quot;prove&quot;). I agree with the part about renaming it because exactly of the fact that it has been thrown around too much and has not been taken seriously by casinos.<br /><br />Probably, the best thing to do is the CGF should create it&#039;s own branding that would specifically say that it has been reviewed by CGF and that brand means like a certified seal of authenticity of sorts. Then this should be verifiable as well in the CGF website probably through a list of casinos that CGF has given its seal of approval. <br /></div><br />I think &#039;provably&#039; is slightly confusing because it looks and sounds too similar to &#039;probably&#039; (which isn&#039;t good) and people are often not sure how it&#039;s even pronounced. It&#039;s obviously pronounced &#039;proove-ably&#039; but I often hear people say it as prov-ably which just leads to confusion (because what the hell is prov-ably?&nbsp; ;D).<br /><br />https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/provably<br /><br />I think a rebranding would be helpful but you could just start referring to it as provably fair / true fairness or verifiably fair etc and see if one of them catches on along with provably or if its use even surpasses that of provably. If this foundation pushes one of them I soon think the phrase would catch on and could become a mark of quality/trust.<br /></div><br />Provably is was likely coined to make full use of the &quot;prove&quot; word, maybe. Can really say for sure. Most of the links I found on google just related it to the word &quot;prove&quot;, I can&#039;t really find any real reference to it being an actual word though.<br /><br />I would still push for the CGF to have its own brand or seal of approval. I believe this is a revolutionary move for the gambling industry and we should move away from the past so we can move to a better future for gambling. And having a rebranded way of marking a website as truly fair, is something, which I believe, is mandatory. Imagine that you can go to a gambling site and truly trust the seals you see on the website. Unlike what we see right now, that every gambling site throws the &quot;provably fair&quot; seal around like it&#039;s nothing. <br /><br />I hope to hear from the lead members of CGF to be honest, and know their opinion on it.<br /></div><br />Every site that has been reviewed and aproved by CGF has the seal in their footer. <br /></div><br />Oh cool, I just realized when you said there was such a seal. Then I got really no other complains about the seal.<br /><br />However, from the other thread I&#039;ve replied to, I would like now to push for CGF to disclose who the members of the committee that reviews the gambling sites. It is paramount importance for people to know who really are the people that are reviewing these sites. Because if CGF really gets traction and it becomes a trusted review agency, we should really know how the process of review goes and who reviews it. Because if CGF is controlled by just one casino then they will have a control over the industry since they can approve or deny any casino at their will just to eliminate competition.<br /><br />I&#039;m deeply interested in this project and I do hope it succeeds. Even if this is a centralized entity, it is still good since gamblers trust their crypto to gambling sites and someone should protect the gamblers. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The concept of the foundation and its efforts to legitimise and clean up the murky crypto-gambling world is to be applauded but how can a foundation that was founded and run by two leading provably fair casino&#039;s be considered to be impartial? A true foundation would have an impartial board of trustees who are transparent in their affiliations (and not two in-house people that vet companies based on their own values) as well as a trustee that independently represents the consumer. For all the best intentions in the world this is not how this such be approached. Perhaps if the founders could pass this on to more impartial individuals it would be better but atm this is basically a PR exercise for those casino&#039;s. <br /><br />If they really wanted to push this further they would publish a white paper outlining what should be considered to be fair industry standards and liaise with the community and brands to establish this independently and transparently. This could then act as a Trustpilot type scheme for brands to sign up to. <br /><br /><br /></div>

A true foundation would have an impartial board of trustees who are transparent in their affiliations (and not two in-house people that vet companies based on their own values) as well as a trustee that independently represents the consumer. For all the best intentions in the world this is not how this such be approached. Perhaps if the founders could pass this on to more impartial individuals it would be better but atm this is basically a PR exercise for those casino&#039;s. <br /><br />If they really wanted to push this further they would publish a white paper outlining what should be considered to be fair industry standards and liaise with the community and brands to establish this independently and transparently. This could then act as a Trustpilot type scheme for brands to sign up to. <br /></div><br />That is a very valuable point, and something that I intend to work upon in the coming weeks. The crypto gambling foundation is actually my project and something I created, independent of the casino&#039;s it represents. (disclaimer: However I do work with community development for both Stake and Primedice, this project is separate to those operations.) I highly value the time you have taken to express your opinions and concerns, its great to have such valuable feedback.<br /><br />I am a big advocate of real fairness and its potential in this industry. There is no financial gain being made by this project and hopefully when properly established we can look at building a board of trustees who can transparently evaluate the provably fair algorithms on all the online gambling sites.<br /></div><br />This is very much a work-in-progress.

At least Stunna is being pretty open about licences being used strictly for marketing - because honestly, that&#039;s what most casinos especially with Bitcoin/crypto want, the marketing. Licensing doesn&#039;t do any favors for gamblers online, least of all with Bitcoin. Casinos that are centralized require gamblers to trust in them. In general, we&#039;ve seen over the years how many have indeed messed players over. You can easily google about former casinos with strict licenses that still screwed players when they decided to pack up.<br /><br />Unless we want to move to decentralized gambling, we have no choice but to trust the people we put our gambling money with. And licencing doesn&#039;t tip the scales in anyone&#039;s favor, definitely not for players!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In my experience, any effort trying to engage Game-Protect in a rational conversation is futile.<br /><br />He has proven himself to not be qualified to provide any legal advice to anyone (even a casual suggestion from him should be ignored)<br /><br />Unfortunately he has continued to spam deceptive hyperlinks to his shit website all over the place in hopes that someone will click the link and provide him some affiliate revenue.<br /><br />I recommend everyone ignore him in any thread other than his own and report any post he makes that contains deceptive hyperlinks (<i>see example below</i>)<br /><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/cb4282b5b28ab7dba476434adb95dd22.png">https://i.gyazo.com/cb4282b5b28ab7dba476434adb95dd22.png</a><br /><br /><br />Surely he will respond to this with a bunch of stupid questions.&nbsp; Just ignore.<br /><br /><br /></div>

Why is it risky to manually change client seed? &nbsp;:-\<br /><br />Is it possible to somehow &quot;inject&quot; bad seeds if gambling site doesn&#039;t use nonce? </div>

And I played there before too, don&#039;t recall any bad blood with any players there. It would be really cool to update the list with when they got membership, when (if) revoked and reasons for those. Transparency and all that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The list is like champions league playoffs in there. All of those websites are literally the places we have always said the best websites in our discussions. Onehash is also provably fair and on the list which is great but for a sportsbook can you guys look for a place that is not using onehash type of system, they are great but you should still look for a regular system sportsbook instead of pvp sportsbook as well.<br /><br />This seems like it started over 1.5 years ago and I have never heard about it until today. It means there needs to be a lot more &quot;marketing&quot; or at least awareness created for this foundation so that more people would see this, you guys built it but never really made big marketing spending for this, mostly focused on making promotions for the website.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would like to scratch the surface a little here.<br />I have first hand experience of organisations of this nature and I can tell you that, regardless of how much marketing spin is used, ultimately any organisation such as this, will only reflect the values and interests of its active members. Good governance should be at the heart of any organisation and is an indicator of its value.<br /><br />In this context may I ask:<br />1: Is there any implemented policy or procedural documentation in place to help achieve good governance?<br />2: Who are the trustees/directors/members currently sitting on the board of this organisation?<br />3: How is the board structured (officers/roles)? <br />4: How are the members of the board appointed to those positions?<br />5: How are the players interests represented on this board?<br /><br /><br />Thank you</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Will you be adding others to your list or will you just wait them to join you? I don&#039;t know who you are contacting and how you accept new places to your list but to be honest with you there are many other places that are provably fair as well. We all know windice and eosbet are provably fair too, eosbet even has their source code open so you can literally check it and see how decentralized and fair they are so there must be absolutely no reason not to add them and if you guys contact windice I am sure they will provide proof as well.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the ways you guys accept or at least add to your list when picking websites so maybe its a slower than usual method but nevertheless not adding other provably fair places people know will make this foundation a bit doubtful and having favoritism in the listing.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The Crypto Gambling Foundation has only 7 members (bustabit, bustadice, bitdice, stake, primedice, betking, and nitrogensports), by now. I would like to known which set of criteria, from which the Crypto Gambling Foundation will consider to accept new members. There are others good casinos, that have not appeared in the Foundation, such as Bitvest, 777 coin, CryptoGames, FortuneJack, Bitsler, Windice, and so on. Maybe because those casinos don&#039;t have interests to join the Foundation, or they have not known about it, or the requirements to join are too strictly.</div>
