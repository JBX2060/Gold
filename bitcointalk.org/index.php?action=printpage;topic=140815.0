					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a balance in a blockchain.info wallet and it simply will not let me send BTC out no matter what I do.<br />I figured I just needed to wait it out for something to get caught up somewhere, but it&#039;s not budging<br />I even tried importing the wallet into a new blockchain.info wallet, and to my desktop client, no dice.<br /><br />I keep getting an insufficient funds message after &quot;Getting Unspent Outputs&quot;, it says I only have .0000005 <br />in my account, although the balance shows 3.58 for more than 36 hours. It&#039;s completely jacked.<br /><br />I sent .01 BTC to myself from the desktop client and the transaction went through but it&#039;s freaking gigantic<br />with tons of extra hashes.<br /><br />I&#039;m really confused about this.<br /><br />Has anyone else had this problem?<br /></div>

The proposed change to accepting BTC on my sales website will be pointless if I cannot combine the BTC revenue into a single BTC balance, <br /></div>Bitcointalk.org is a great place to learn about it. &nbsp;I&#039;ll explain a bit below. &nbsp;Post any further questions you have about it and I&#039;m sure that someone (maybe even me) will answer.<br /><br />Lets assume for the moment that you are collecting at least the equivalent of 1 USD for each book.<br />Furthermore, lets assume every input in your wallet is one of these book sale transactions.<br /><br />At today&#039;s exchange rate, each output that you receive will be approximately 0.05 BTC.<br /><br />Now lets assume that you want to spend 50 BTC (1000 USD) from this book sales wallet to a single output address.<br /><br />Each input is approximately 180 bytes and you will need 1000 of them, so your transaction will be 180,000 bytes in size.<br />The current transaction fee is 0.0005 BTC per kilobyte. &nbsp;So you will pay about 0.09 BTC (1.80 USD) in fees to send the 50 BTC (1000 USD) transaction. This works out to approximately a 0.18% fee.<br /><br /><i>Now imagine that you are playing Satoshi Dice, where every losing bet sends 0.00000001 BTC to your wallet.<br />Imagine that you&#039;ve played a lot of Satoshi Dice and all you have left in your wallet is 0.00005 BTC (0.001 USD) of these 0.00000001 BTC outputs.<br />You decide to spend this 0.00005 BTC. &nbsp;This is <b>5,000 inputs</b> at 180 bytes each, so your transaction will be 900,000 bytes in size. &nbsp;At 0.0005 BTC per kilobyes you&#039;ll need approximately 0.45 BTC in fees to send the 0.00005 BTC.</i><br /><br />If you are really concerned about the extremely small fees that business transactions larger than 0.01 USD will eventually incur, you can make an effort to combine your outputs on a regular basis. Create a second wallet with an address you&#039;ll use as a &quot;consolidation address&quot;. &nbsp;After every 50 transactions (or something less if you prefer), send the total balance (or most of it) from the business wallet to the &quot;consolidation address&quot;. &nbsp;This will create a transaction with 50 inputs (or less if you do it more often). &nbsp;50 inputs at 180 bytes per input is 9,000 bytes, leaving 1000 bytes for your output and any overhead/headers I may not have considered. &nbsp;Since transactions less than 10,000 bytes in size don&#039;t automatically require a fee, this should consolidate the entire balance into a single output in the &quot;consolidation address&quot;. &nbsp;I suppose that every 2,500 transactions you&#039;ll want to send the balance from the &quot;consolidation address&quot; to a &quot;re-consolidation address&quot;, since at that time you&#039;ll have 50 outputs at the .consolidation address&quot;. (and after 125,000 transactions you may want to consolidate the outputs at that address?)<br /><br />Note that transactions that exceed 10,000 bytes are not the only type of transaction that incurs a fee. &nbsp;The bitcoin protocol as currently implemented in the reference client and several other wallets also demands a 0.0005 BTC fee if any output is less than 0.01 BTC. &nbsp;It also requires a fee if the inputs are not sufficiently aged. &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure, but there may be another fee trigger as well.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you very much, DannyHamilton! Let me see if I understand.<br /><br />When address XYZ sends out its balance, the outgoing transaction is of a size such as to contain data about each of the incoming transactions that created the balance in the XYZ address.<br /><br />100 xfers --&gt; [addy1] --&gt; 1 xfer w/ 100 inputs --&gt; [addy2] --&gt; 1 xfer w/ 1 input --&gt; [addy3]<br /><br />And so, for example: One hundred 1-BTC transactions come into addy1. When addy1 sends one 100-BTC transaction (its balance) to addy2, that addy1-to-addy2 transaction&#039;s size includes info about each of the 100 inputs that came into addy1. But when addy2 sends its 100-BTC balance to addy3, the addy2-to-addy3 transaction includes only one input. Is that the way it works?<br /><br />If so, this brings up another hypothetical question. To make sure that I understood. Say that I invest in BTC with dollar-cost averaging. I buy a fixed USD value of BTC every Wednesday and put each batch of newly purchased BTC into the same address. If I spend it all after one year, the outgoing transaction will contain 52 inputs. But if I wait 10 years to spend it, the outgoing transaction will contain 520 inputs. Right?</div>

(actually, since 365 is not evenly divisable by 7 and there will be at least one and maybe two leap years, there should be a year with an extra Wednesday so after 10 years you should have as many as 521 inputs).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got this sorted out after experimentation. Just in case anyone else ever gets themself in this situation here&#039;s how you fix it:<br /><br />We&#039;ll call the locked up wallet: Wallet-X<br />Completely different wallet: Wallet-Y<br />We&#039;ll assume Wallet-X has only one address for sending/receiving.<br /><br />1. Create 1-2 new addresses in Wallet-X<br /><br />2. Send some BTC from Wallet-Y to one of the new Wallet-X addresses, wait for the transaction to confirm.<br /><br />3. Send a little bit of the BTC back to Wallet-Y using the Custom transaction type in the following configuration:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a.) Set FROM address to the NEW address that shows the BTC you just transferred<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b.) Set the TO address to your Wallet-Y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c.) Set the CHANGE address to the original Wallet-X address that has the funds locked up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; d.) Send the transaction and wait for it to confirm.<br /><br />4. You should now be able to send the BTC that was previously locked up.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s neccesary to do it this way. You would assume that it would be the same as if you sent BTC directly to the original wallet address, but it only works if it comes back as CHANGE, not a direct transaction.</div>

I was thinking about accepting BTC on my book-sales website. But this will result in my receiving &quot;lots of small transfers&quot; as people buy books. The proposed change to accepting BTC on my sales website will be pointless if I cannot combine the BTC revenue into a single BTC balance, <br /></div>Bitcointalk.org is a great place to learn about it. &nbsp;I&#039;ll explain a bit below. &nbsp;Post any further questions you have about it and I&#039;m sure that someone (maybe even me) will answer.<br /><br />Lets assume for the moment that you are collecting at least the equivalent of 1 USD for each book.<br />Furthermore, lets assume every input in your wallet is one of these book sale transactions.<br /><br />At today&#039;s exchange rate, each output that you receive will be approximately 0.05 BTC.<br /><br />Now lets assume that you want to spend 50 BTC (1000 USD) from this book sales wallet to a single output address.<br /><br />Each input is approximately 180 bytes and you will need 1000 of them, so your transaction will be 180,000 bytes in size.<br />The current transaction fee is 0.0005 BTC per kilobyte. &nbsp;So you will pay about 0.09 BTC (1.80 USD) in fees to send the 50 BTC (1000 USD) transaction. This works out to approximately a 0.18% fee.<br /><br /><i>Now imagine that you are playing Satoshi Dice, where every losing bet sends 0.00000001 BTC to your wallet.<br />Imagine that you&#039;ve played a lot of Satoshi Dice and all you have left in your wallet is 0.00005 BTC (0.001 USD) of these 0.00000001 BTC outputs.<br />You decide to spend this 0.00005 BTC. &nbsp;This is <b>5,000 inputs</b> at 180 bytes each, so your transaction will be 900,000 bytes in size. &nbsp;At 0.0005 BTC per kilobyes you&#039;ll need approximately 0.45 BTC in fees to send the 0.00005 BTC.</i><br /><br />If you are really concerned about the extremely small fees that business transactions larger than 0.01 USD will eventually incur, you can make an effort to combine your outputs on a regular basis. Create a second wallet with an address you&#039;ll use as a &quot;consolidation address&quot;. &nbsp;After every 50 transactions (or something less if you prefer), send the total balance (or most of it) from the business wallet to the &quot;consolidation address&quot;. &nbsp;This will create a transaction with 50 inputs (or less if you do it more often). &nbsp;50 inputs at 180 bytes per input is 9,000 bytes, leaving 1000 bytes for your output and any overhead/headers I may not have considered. &nbsp;Since transactions less than 10,000 bytes in size don&#039;t automatically require a fee, this should consolidate the entire balance into a single output in the &quot;consolidation address&quot;. &nbsp;I suppose that every 2,500 transactions you&#039;ll want to send the balance from the &quot;consolidation address&quot; to a &quot;re-consolidation address&quot;, since at that time you&#039;ll have 50 outputs at the .consolidation address&quot;. (and after 125,000 transactions you may want to consolidate the outputs at that address?)<br /><br />Note that transactions that exceed 10,000 bytes are not the only type of transaction that incurs a fee. &nbsp;The bitcoin protocol as currently implemented in the reference client and several other wallets also demands a 0.0005 BTC fee if any output is less than 0.01 BTC. &nbsp;It also requires a fee if the inputs are not sufficiently aged. &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure, but there may be another fee trigger as well.<br /><br /></div><br />Thanks for the information, very helpful.</div>
