So as per your comment Amazon did provide this 150$ credit coupon for Amazon Elastic compute cloud before and suddenly decided not to provide that service LOL .. but everyone can see &quot; <b>AMAZON ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD</b> &quot; listed in <b>Applicable Products List</b> . As far i understand you don&#039;t even know how to operate AWS and for your Information , I am using that right now . also as i told you before after apply the code to aws account go to &quot; Credits &quot; section and check beside event name &quot; Applicable Products Tab <b>See complete list</b> &quot; for this service listed or not . I will not go to more argue with you since you just post invalid claim which proof you don&#039;t have . <br />Here is the proof that credit works fine with EC2 [ <b>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</b> ] , so next time you come to my thread and question my service think twice and better come with some knowledge that what you are claiming :) Thanks for your invalid claim . <br /><br /><a href="https://s27.postimg.org/xk3w8w5z7/AWSC.png">https://s27.postimg.org/xk3w8w5z7/AWSC.png</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There is nothing wrong with these codes, I bought a lot of them and if there was any problem that the seller wouldn&#039;t be willing to fix I would be the first to warn the others and put him on my personal list of scammers. In fact I did the very opposite, I put Blackshadow007 on my list of legit sellers and the list is very short (6 active sellers).<br /><br />Blackshadow007, you are right, the kid is giving you free bumps and as a side effect he also entertains the whole forum with his stupidity. What more can you possibly wish for? :)</div>

You are allowed max 4x per AWS Account for that means if you have Q4_12 you cannot add Q4_10 if previously 4x added and same if you already have Q4_10 previously 4x then you cannot add Q4_12 to that same AWS account &nbsp;:) ; always ask me any inquiry before purchase and clear your mind . <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

You can know basic event name of course but these actual name &quot;EDU_QXX_XXX_XX&quot; Appears after apply and i checked that time it was Q_10 so i told you but amazon changed from Q10 to Q12 when that&#039;s not possible to know actually . I updated the thread about this series now so if you think to purchase from now on Q_12 is there you have to know . Thanks . <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

If Amazon finds out you are using these codes they will remove them from your account so you couldn&#039;t use them to pay for the expenses you accrued. Even removed they will still count as for the redeemable limit (i.e. 4 EDU codes from the same event per AWS account), though, so if you already maxed the limit you can&#039;t buy them again and redeem them again anymore. Also, Amazon may &quot;flag&quot; your account, meaning if you redeem some EDU codes again the chance of them being discovered and removed may be higher. If Amazon doesn&#039;t notice before the invoice is issued (usually on the 3rd day of the following month) then your codes will be used to pay your bill and you are off the hook.<br /><br />Oficially, the codes should cover only the expenses you accrued after you redeemed the codes, but usually (not always!) they do retroactively affect also the expenses you accrued anytime within the given month, so one strategy could be to redeem the codes just before the month is over which gives Amazon the least time to react. I wouldn&#039;t rely on it too much, though, as exactly for this reason they are known to check the accounts just before the month ends.<br /><br />Just because using these codes is risky doesn&#039;t mean they are unusable. There are scenarioes where these codes are just perfect, regardless of whether they are wiped out later or not. Please don&#039;t ask for details, you need to figure it out yourself.</div>

After you add credit then the active or new Instances will consume the available credits first and when all credits consumed then your Payment card . Please before arguing about this check again carefully and learn a bit more about AWS . <br /><br />Go to your credit history and after you redeem you can see Right side &quot; <b>See Complete List</b> &quot; under &quot; <i>Applicable Services Tab</i> . <br />Check that list below EC2 Container its mentioned as &quot; <b>AMAZON ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD</b> &quot; that is called EC2<br /><br />https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/<br /><br /></div>

Now you can use with edu credits but if in future your edu credits get revoked then all other gets revoke with that too , so if you use both edu and non edu together you would be risking your non edu premium credits with edu risk . That&#039;s the point of that sentence , hope i explained you difference now . <br /><br /><br /></div>

That&#039;s why it&#039;s cheaper. Also you need to be part of the AWS education program with a special account type.<br /></div><br />No you are wrong , you do not need to be part of AWS Educate to use the edu credits , any aws account verified with CC and Phone can use the EDU or NON EDU Credits , Difference is EDU carry certain risk and Non EDU don&#039;t if used alone . <br /></div>

Each event credit has its own limits and nothing is monthly or lifetime here . You buy credit and redeem and that particular credit has an expiry date which you can see in descriptions of credit and you have time until that to use your credits after redeemption . Now for EDU Credit usually each month new event comes and when new event come you can stack more new event credit in your same aws account . Hope i made things clear to you know , thanks for your interest . <br /><br /></div>

You always have to remember you can always add new EDU Events whenever you see it . Just do remember of the event name which you currently using and used in past and if you see new event name then you can simply add that as per its limit [ for example this 150 max can be added 2x per aws acc ] . So if you didnt add this particular FY2019_Q2_1 Before then yes you can add 2x in one aws acc . Thanks for your interest . </div>
