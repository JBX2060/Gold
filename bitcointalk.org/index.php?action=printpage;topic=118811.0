					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A couple days ago I noticed my wallet was not up to date and a couple of my transactions were not showing.&nbsp; It seemed to be stuck at block 202762.&nbsp; I have a warning at the bottom of the wallet that says, &quot;Warning: Displayed transactions may not be correct!&nbsp; You may need to upgrade, or other nodes r&quot; and it stops there.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see what else it is saying.&nbsp; I went to Bitcoin.org and got the latest client which is version 7.0 beta.&nbsp; I downloaded it and saw it was a little different.&nbsp; It was still stuck at block 202762.&nbsp; I let it run for over a day and it didn&#039;t change.&nbsp; It said it was 99.6% complete but never went past 202762 though it did say out of 203,000 something.&nbsp; After running it over a day I went ahead and deleted my Bitcoin folder from the programs (86) file.&nbsp; I then redownloaded the new client and tried starting over.&nbsp; Same result.&nbsp; It starts out stuck at block 202762.&nbsp; The wallet shows it is &quot;out of sync&quot;.&nbsp; The little arrow in the corner is turning as it was the first time and says, &quot;Catching up.&nbsp; Downloaded 202762 of 203,593 blocks of transaction history (99.59% done).&nbsp; Last recieved block was generated 5 days ago.&quot;&nbsp; I am showing 17 active connections and the same Warning is displaying.&nbsp; So any ideas on what could be going wrong?&nbsp; I do use the Armory wallet but it depends on the Bitcoin-QT client working and being up to date.&nbsp; Strangely, my Armory wallet shows, &quot;Connected (202,789 blocks)&quot; at the bottom of the page which is a little different than the 202,762 that Bitcoin-QT seems to be stuck at.&nbsp; Anyway I am not sure what is wrong or how to fix it can anyone help?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Make sure the Bitcoin client is not running and then go to the directory &quot;C:/Users/&quot;your username&quot;/Appdata/Roaming/Bitcoin&quot; and move the files blk001, blk002, and blkindex to My Documents.&nbsp; You will have to show hidden files and folders.&nbsp; (if you don&#039;t know how to do this just search show hidden files and folders in the start menu)&nbsp; Then start the Bitcoin client and wait for it to re-download the blockchain. :P&nbsp; The block chain is over four GB so leave the client running overnight.&nbsp; This is a semi-common problem, and the only way I&#039;ve ever heard to fix it was to either let the Bitcoin client re-download the blockchain, or to download and replace the blockchain manually(This is more difficult yet faster and more reliable fix.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That seems like a good idea.&nbsp; Thanks, BookLover.&nbsp; I moved the files and then deleted them from the AppData file and restarted the program.&nbsp; It is now loading the whole block chain.&nbsp; Hopefully this will solve the problem.&nbsp; I will know tomorrow.&nbsp; I think this is going to work.&nbsp; I guess when it does I can just delete those files from my Documents as I won&#039;t need them anymore once the whole blockchain downloads.&nbsp; It looks like it might not take till tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone through the first 100,000 in less than ten minutes.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m glad things are looking up for you. :D&nbsp; Unfortunately, the blockchain download becomes much slower during the later blocks due to the increased transaction activity, so it may take longer than expected. :-\</div>
