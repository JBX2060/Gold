					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A B with two lines through it without the circle may be a bit confusing or too similar to the Thai currency considering the US$ symbol is sometimes used with one or two lines.&nbsp; So additionally a circle around it like the icon used with the client and also the favicon used at this site seems like a good idea.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://unicode.org/pending/proposals.html#Interim_Solutions<br /><br />There are ways for programmers and scholarly organizations to make use of Unicode character encoding, even if the script they want to use or transmit is not yet (or may never be) part of the Unicode Standard. Individual groups that make use of rare scripts or special characters can reach a private agreement about interchange and set aside part of the Private Use Area to encode their private set of characters. Individuals with interests in rare scripts or materials relating to them may sometimes be contacted through an electronic mail list which the Consortium maintains.&nbsp; For information about these mail lists, please contact the Unicode office.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since this is an open source project, would it be acceptable for individuals to take initiative amongst themselves to develop a kind of committee to put forth effort into deciding upon how to officially represent Bitcoins with a particular symbol or should we instead rely on Satoshi Nakamoto as authority over determining this type of establishment within Bitcoin?</div>

It&#039;s sharing and sharing is caring. Seriously, who&#039;s it hurting? If anything, it promotes Thailand and the Thai baht. I certainly had never heard of the baht before I chose it as the symbol for bitcoins. Does a baby in Thailand go hungry every time I use the baht symbol to represent bitcoins?

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I believe the Baht symbol is the best option for Bitcoin denotation however would recommend a small change, &#3647;C for BitCoin instead of just &#3647;.<br /><br />This would allow for differentiation of the two easily should they ever be listed side by side and is the same setup as the Nicaraguan córdoba which uses the US $ in its currency symbolism written as C$<br /><br />For long hand (eg. those who can&#039;t type the Baht symbol for some reason) the use of BTC can be used in place of the &#3647;C as no currency in place currently makes use of BTC as the long hand for their currency (eg. USD for US Dollar, GBP for British Pound, etc...).<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br /><b>50&#3647;C/month</b><br /><b>50 BTC/month</b></div>

We could also consider a more &quot;open&quot; symbol, like £ and €.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi guys, I know I am late to the conversation but could you please not use the Thai baht symbol as it&#039;s very confusing for someone like me who actually lives in Thailand. You&#039;d be making it extremely confusing to use BitCoins over here.<br /><br />Also, why would you want to use an existing symbol rather then create your own cool new one? ;D All it does is dilute the meaning of both BitCoins and Thai Baht. These days you can load up true type fonts via css so it&#039;s not like you wouldn&#039;t be able to use the symbol anywhere on the site. At least choose a symbol that&#039;s not already a currency somewhere in the world.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No, there&#039;s a whole set of letters and numbers with circles around them in the Unicode standard.&nbsp; I honestly have no idea why they&#039;re there, but I guess they&#039;re coming in handy for us.<br /><br />http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2460.pdf</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The &quot;8 with a line through&quot; variations just make it look like the price of whatever it is you&#039;re selling used to cost 8 but now costs something else.<br />I like the unicode capital B with the circle around it. &#9399;<br /><br />If it looks bad it&#039;s just because the font designer probably didn&#039;t put a lot of effort into that one particular character.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that we should not use the Bhat symbol as the bit coin symbol. I do like the b in the circle &#9425; as it is fairly easy to read at normal font sizes. I prefer <span style="font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">&#9373;</span> &#9373; <span style="font-size: 8pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">&#9373;</span> which easier to read at small sizes (down to 8pt font)&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 8pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">&#9373;</span> . The nice thing about using the &#9373; is it can be mimicked without Unicode by (b). I think it would be nice to use a symbol that could otherwise be &quot;drawn&quot; on my every pc with or without Unicode.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not all currencies use a special symbol, some just use letters. For example, the South African Rand (ZAR) is just R.<br /><br />Two rand and 45 cents is just R2.45.<br /><br />Two bitcoins and 45 centibits could be B2.45.<br /><br />Anyway, what&#039;s the plan for subdividing bitcoins? Do we go in thousands like the metric system (millibits, microbits, nanobits)?<br /><br />Or do we have names for subdivisions? A hundredth of a bitcoin could be a Satoshi, a thousandth of that could be a Molyneau, and a thousandth of that could be an Austrian.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I prefer &#9425; (&#039;b in a circle&#039; for whom Unicode won&#039;t display properly). It combines the notions of bits with the lower case b and coins with the circle. Furthermore, I find it simple, distinct, and easy to write by hand. Although the Bhat symbol, &#3647;, is also simple and easy to write, it is neither distinct nor clever. Bitcoin deserves a trademark befitting of its characteristics.<br /><br />Keep in mind, the use of such a symbol will not preclude the use of the currency code BTC.</div>

Websites wishing to display can host the necessary fonts for browsers. Typesetting programs should accommodate the symbol without much trouble for formal documents.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For those running Firefox on Windows XP for whom &#9425;, the unicode character 24D1, doesn&#039;t display properly, I have an easy fix:<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Download the Quivira font from this page (http://www.quivira-font.com/).<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extract the file and install the font according to this guide (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314960).<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Firefox, select Tools --&gt; Options and then the Content tab. Under Fonts &amp; Colors, click the Advanced button.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select &#039;Other Languages&#039; in the Fonts for drop down field.<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select &#039;Serif&#039; in the Proportional field.<br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select &#039;Quivira&#039; in both the Serif and Sans-serif fields.<br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select &#039;Western (ISO-8859-1)&#039; in the Default Character Encoding field.<br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the &#039;OK&#039; button in the current window, and then again the next window.<br /><br />&#9425; should now display properly in your browser.

If BTC ever becomes popular globally, how will Thai peeps know difference between &#3647;3 and &#3647;3?<br /><br />Any new symbol needs a unicode number in the private use area (see Apple logo at U+F8FF &#63743;) until accepted into UCS, a font made, and people have to start using it… it’s a very hard choice.<br /><b>But</b>, it’s imo better than co-opting something like &#9425;, even if it is awesome, because semantically it means nothing. its just a glyph in front of a number to computers.<br />It would make more sense to have BTC or (b) in common use and then, in the distant future, propose something more stylish to unicode c.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Something to consider is character code 164 (hex 00A4) which will display on virtually every computer even if there is no Unicode font installed.<br /><br />The name of this character is &quot;currency symbol&quot;, and it was intended for use with any new currency. It was never used much because new currencies such as the Euro designed a new character.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the symbol: <span style="font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">¤</span>.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the look of the symbol myself, but I&#039;m throwing it in for discussion.</div>

I think it&#039;s best to have a separate name for this, rather than messing with long decimals like 0.00000247. For the purpose of this discussion, suppose a millionth of a bitcoin is called a satoshi. Then it makes sense to choose a letter symbol that comes in a &quot;B&quot; form and an &quot;S&quot; form.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it would look for large-to-small transactions, using circled-letter symbols. It might be worth seeing how other schemes would deal with the huge range of transaction sizes.<br /><br />&#9425;24700 (twenty-four thousand seven hundred bitcoins)<br />&#9425;2470 (two thousand four hundred and seventy bitcoins)<br />&#9425;247 (two hundred and forty-seven bitcoins) [omit &quot;and&quot; in the USA]<br />&#9425;24.7 (twenty-four point seven bitcoins)<br />&#9425;2.47 (two point four seven bitcoins)<br />&#9442;247000 (two hundred and forty-seven thousand satoshis)<br />&#9442;24700 (twenty-four thousand seven hundred satoshis)<br />&#9442;2470 (two thousand four hundred and seventy satoshis)<br />&#9442;247 (two hundred and forty-seven satoshis)<br />&#9442;24.7 (twenty-four point seven satoshis)<br />&#9442;2.47 (two point four seven satoshis)<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I live in Mexico, where the symbol for MXN (Mexican pesos) is $, same as USD. In everydaylife, this causes no problem, since there&#039;s no ambiguity: everything is written in pesos, you pay in pesos, you charge in pesos. From time to time, though, there&#039;s an ambiguity about whether the price is in USD or in MXN, especially in &quot;international&quot; zones (airports, touristic places, a whole big part of the Internet, etc.). When I first arrived at the airport, I found the price for losing one&#039;s &quot;forma migratoria&quot; ($80 or $100 IIRC) very high, until I realized it was Mexican pesos. Also, on an art website I&#039;m doing (http://plaztika.com), prices are in Mexican pesos, and I can&#039;t use the $ symbol because it would be ambiguous. Some French artists will join the website soon and will have prices in EUR, and in that case I&#039;ll be able to use €, but for prices in pesos, I&#039;ll have to stick to &quot;MXN&quot;, which means concretely that the $ symbol cannot be used. Same for any future artwork sold in American dollars, I&#039;ll need to use &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;dollars&quot;. Sad but true. I&#039;ve been hating this long before I heard about Bitcoins, so this is not a tweaked argument.<br /><br />The same situation could happen if &#3647; were used for both BTC and THB (Thai Bath): it will work as long as there&#039;s no ambiguity (e.g. here on this forum), but for example on that art website I won&#039;t be able to use it ever.<br /><br />So it&#039;s fine by me if people start using &#3647;, but it will be only a partial feature. While it&#039;s still time to choose, let&#039;s be more clever than that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think &#9425; could cause confusion in Boston...&nbsp; &nbsp;as it could be mistaken for the logo for the Boston Bruins (see http://www.sportslogos.net/logo.php?id=27 )<br /><br />And since 1.00 THB = 0.0329327 USD, I think the beautiful wonderful Buddhist people of Thailand will be very happy indeed if you pay them in BTC instead of THB.&nbsp; &nbsp;:) </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Besides sports team logo is used in other context than currency symbols, so you can&#039;t really confuse it.<br />If I would have to choose already existing symbol, I would probably choose &#9399; because it looks similar to the unofficial logo.</div>

Eventually, deflation will have us using centi, milli, and micro bitcoins. Denoting them as cBTC, mBTC, and uBTC respectively. Doing so with any currency symbol just doesn&#039;t look right.</div>

You can see this sometimes on electronic circuit diagrams where a 4.7k ohm resistor is labelled 4k7 so that there&#039;s no confusion due to missed decimal points.<br /><br />That solution also covers the situation of very large units being needed. So, if we used &quot;m&quot; for a milli-bitcoin and &quot;u&quot; for a micro-bitcoin, we could have denominations such as 2m50, 7504b25 or 400u.<br /><br />Of course this notation will never fly with the average Joe, so I&#039;m not proposing it seriously.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t like the &#3647; from the beginning. It looks like a crossed out (because of error) B. And the fact that it is already being used for the Thai currency puts me off.<br /><br />The $ sign is being used by many currencies, but I guess these countries adopted the sign before the age of globalization. <br /><br />Since we are creating a new sign from scratch, we should really try to avoid something that is ready in used.<br /><br />In the long run, bitcoin might become the global internet currency, so exchanges between other currencies will become very common. So we need to avoid the possible confusion 1&#3647; = 2&#3647;, and not knowing which is Thai, which is bitcoin. We can never assume people will also make things clear. Some mistakes are totally unintentional.<br /><br />The representation of Byte (B) and bit (b) is a good point, so many people prefer the &#9425;.<br /><br />However, the &#9399; is closer to current logo, and it renders better in small fonts.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The &#3647; symbol already has an official Unicode name &quot;THAI CURRENCY SYMBOL BAHT&quot;.<br /><br />Unless bitcoin change its name to &quot;Bahtcoin&quot;, we should not mess with other countries currency symbol. <br /><br />Especially the &#3647; symbol is only used exclusively for the Thai Baht now, I am sure they will have a strong attachment and ownership feeling towards this symbol.<br /><br />If I were Thai, i would not be happy about that.<br /><br />People using the $ may not have such feelings, because so many other currencies are using the $ symbol.<br /><br />It takes a long time for Unicode to adopt a new character. Something that is already in Unicode is much more convenient. Once adopted, people all over the world can use it, type it (or at least copy and paste) it immediately.<br /><br />Bitcoin don&#039;t have to have a currency symbol, but a currency is really a logo, an identity. Bitcoin is for the electronic medium. It is international. For example, if shown on a shopping website, people knows straight away that the price shown is in Bitcoin (but not Thai baht!).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For symbols not yet officially in Unicode, there is the private use area, and there is an organisation,&nbsp; forgot the name, that helps coordinate the use of that area. Even if we haven&#039;t decided what it should look like yet, perhaps it might be possible to reserve a codepoint there.<br /><br /><br />Once we settle on a symbol, we can make a font with it, and webpages can use embeded font to render that character correctly for anyone with a modern browser.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My girlfriend and I like myrkul/Gokhan&#039;s idea. We tried it out a few times and it&#039;s rather easy to write. Plus we think its reminiscent of the @ symbol, quite apropos for a digi-currency.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Only two minor concerns with Gokhan&#039;s &quot;b&#039;at&quot; symbol:<br />- Because the @ symbol already has many uses, we must make sure our symbol is sufficiently visually distinctive.&nbsp; The @ in @37.50, for example, already denotes the concept of &quot;unit price&quot;.&nbsp; However, I think might not be a problem, as nobody complains that $ is not visually distinctive from S.<br />- Since the circle shape is very &quot;fat&quot; compared to most currency symbols, we&#039;d want to be sure to design it in such a way that the typographic layout would be appealing when it is written with digits next to it.&nbsp; (IMO @37.50 does not look as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;money-like&quot; as $37.50, 37.50 &#3647;, etc.)<br /><br />Other than that, I think the symbol is unique, eye-catching, and very good at communicating &quot;bitcoin&quot;.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What you said about it potentially being confused with the @ symbol got me thinking. You&#039;re right, that would look rather odd. I came up with another symbol which I&#039;ve written down on a scrap of paper and photographed. You can see it below. It avoids the problem of looking like any other currency symbol or symbol it is likely to be used in conjunction with and it is easy to write.<br /><br /><a href="http://ryepdx.com/bitcoin.JPG">http://ryepdx.com/bitcoin.JPG</a><br /><br />What do you think?</div>

Here they are, along with another rendering of the first one I posted:<br /><a href="http://ryepdx.com/bitcoin2.jpg">http://ryepdx.com/bitcoin2.jpg</a><br /><br />These are crude renderings, but they should prove a good basis for any typographers who may come along later.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, I just finished reading all 10 pages of this discussion. It seems to me we are divided into two camps:<br /><br />1. Those who want a symbol we can start using right away.<br />2. Those who want a unique symbol that we won&#039;t really be able to use online until we manage to get a character into the unicode set (which could be a few years considering it took the Thai government about a year of lobbying to get their country&#039;s currency symbol into that set, a task easier than the one we would face as a mere confederacy of nerds.)<br /><br />I think we ought to decide which approach would be better for us as a community.<br /><br />There is, of course, a middle path: we could create a custom symbol and then host it as an image somewhere for the whole community to use as if it were a character.<br /><br />If we decide path 1 is best, then my votes are for &#946;, &#579;, or &#9399; (in order of preference.)<br />If we decide path 2 or the middle path is best, well, you&#039;ve seen my suggestions.<br /><br />What are your thoughts?</div>

It looks nice and is easily recognisable as a symbol representing money while still being different enough from the Baht symbol &#3647;.<br /><br /><a href="http://hammeroftruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bitcoin-logo.jpg">http://hammeroftruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bitcoin-logo.jpg</a><br /><br /></div>

We&#039;re only a sort of confederacy at best and there&#039;s nobody here that can force anyone else into anything. The only official documentation we have is the wiki, and most of it (excluding the Bitcoin protocol itself) is the result of collective decision making. As far as I&#039;m concerned, requiring the symbol to look exactly like the logo would be silly. The rule would get ignored as soon as the symbol began to get incorporated into other typefaces, I imagine. But whatever catches on is what will persist and thus become &quot;official.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m just hoping it&#039;s not that misappropriated &quot;baht&quot; symbol that gets popularized.</div>

It seems to me we are divided into two camps:<br /><br />1. Those who want a symbol we can start using right away.<br />2. Those who want a unique symbol that we won&#039;t really be able to use online until we manage to get a character into the unicode set (which could be a few years considering it took the Thai government about a year of lobbying to get their country&#039;s currency symbol into that set, a task easier than the one we would face as a mere confederacy of nerds.)<br /><br />I think we ought to decide which approach would be better for us as a community.<br /></div><br />I am in the second camp. To me, Bitcoin is a new and exciting idea. It&#039;s original, so it should have an original symbol that represents it uniquely. It also has potential to become a universal currency that transcends political boundaries, so I really think it should not co-opt an existing currency&#039;s symbol.<br /><br />I agree that it could take a long time before Bitcoin is big enough to be represented with its own Unicode character, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a problem we need to worry about at this stage. If Bitcoin is truly a worthwhile and meaningful idea destined for mass recognition, Unicode adoption will eventually follow. Worrying about Unicode representation beforehand is, I think, putting the cart before the horse. Until then, &quot;BTC&quot; is perfectly understandable in the digital realm.<br /><br />That said, I really like the b&#039;at:<br /><br /><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/a/ad/Bat.png">https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/a/ad/Bat.png</a><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Having just read through this entire thread I can see that there are some very good arguments for a number of the candidates.&nbsp; Personally I think that the symbol ought to be an existing UTF-8 symbol so that it can be readily used on most systems or browsers and not require additional fonts to be installed.<br /><br />I like the &#3647; symbol because it is very clear and easy to read, but the arguments against deliberately choosing the symbol of another currency are reasonable (even if that has already been done with $ and ¥).<br /><br />Of the other already proposed unicode characters I&#039;d then look at &#9399;.&nbsp; I think &#9425; is a little too difficult to read in most standard font sizes (10pt or 12pt).<br /><br />I have, however, considered a couple of other characters.&nbsp; I looked for characters which were reminiscent of combining a 1 and a 0, since they&#039;re what make a bit.&nbsp; An obvious candidate would be Ø (U+00d8), except that could easily be mistaken for a zero in some fonts.&nbsp; The other one, which I am a little more in favour of is &#632; (U+0278).<br /><br />A double stroked B (with or without a circle) would be great, but such a beast is not available in UTF-8 and there&#039;s no real point in picking a symbol that may never be able to be added (and if it is wouldn&#039;t be for several years).&nbsp; The copyleft symbol still hasn&#039;t been added to unicode and it has far more people pushing for it.&nbsp; I think that getting creative with the logo is a great way to push Bitcoin, but a recognised symbol should be able to be used straight away in order to push adoption of the currency.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">All this over which &quot;B&quot; symbol to use? &nbsp;My thought would be to go with something unique, something unused in currency, and lying outside currency symbology:<br /><br />&#8710;<br /><br />&#8710;2.33<br /><br />And the delta symbol relates to the letter &quot;d&quot; - as in Digital...<br /><br />Of course, the Triforce would be sick, but might not show up well in smaller sizes and obviously does not live in unicode.<br /><br />Whatcha think?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Every week I&#039;m torn between 2 different symbols. This week it&#039;s &#946; and &#579; (http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9562.0) Right now, I&#039;m leaning towards &#946; because of how easy it is to right, and how it just kind of naturally looks like a currency symbol.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think one other issue that needs to be considered is how the bitcoin symbol would look when expressing values far smaller than 1 BTC. &nbsp;I know it hasn&#039;t been absolutely established yet that BTC will use SI units, but I think it is highly likely that we will end up using the convention of 0.001 BTC = 1 milli-bitcoin and 0.000001 BTC = 1 micro-bitcoin. &nbsp;If that&#039;s the case, then we will probably end up using &quot;m&quot; for milli and &quot;&#956;&quot; for micro.<br /><br />When you set the various symbols next to these prefixes, they look like this:<br /><br />0.001 &#3647; = 1 m&#3647; = 1000 &#956;&#3647;<br />0.001 &#9399; = 1 m&#9399; = 1000 &#956;&#9399;<br />0.001 &#9425; = 1 m&#9425; = 1000 &#956;&#9425;<br />0.001 &#579; = 1 m&#579; = 1000 &#956;&#579;<br />0.001 ¤ = 1 m¤ = 1000 &#956;¤<br />0.001 &#946; = 1 m&#946; = 1000 &#956;&#946;<br /><br />To me, the &#9399; and &#9425; symbols look very awkward in these cases, whereas the others are more aesthetically pleasing. &nbsp;My personal preference is for the &#3647; symbol, since it looks like money. &nbsp;Since that&#039;s being used as the Bhat currency symbol already, though, my second choice would be for the &#946;, since it has a nice visual flow when combined with the milli and micro prefixes.<br /><br /><br /></div>

Excluding all scenarios where money is being moved or transferred, it&#039;s <i>still</i> probably the most commonly written on paper in the US.<br /><br />Children learn to write currency symbols in school, people write of them in journals, on post-it notes, scraps of paper. Most of the world does not have a computer in their home.<br /><br />Not being able to write down a symbol representing currency easily would serve as a handicap.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It appears that Unicode has given Bitcoin the finger as far as having a designation for a Bitcoin character included.<br /><br />Now the question is: which private use area character code do we use? The representation of the symbol is really up to font designers, but with a recommended form of upper-case B with top and bottom double-ticks.<br /><br />I suggest U+EBC0 (and call it &quot;Latin Capital B with Double Stroke&quot; or simply &quot;Bitcoin Currency Sign&quot;), unless anybody can cite any other software or fonts that use this particular private mapping code. A font can be created with just this additional character, and most OSs will search other fonts for the private character and use it when the current font doesn&#039;t include it. <br /><br />&#12349; = Unicode Bitcoin exchange rate graph...<br /><br />&#5844;&#5856;&#5832; &#128039;</div>

Then something like BabelMap (http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelMap.html) is a character map replacement that will let you see more characters.<br /><br />The penguin originates in Japanese emoji (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) characters, which are used in Japanese cel phones for cute text messages (and now work on iPhone4S too).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I fired off an email to the BitCoin Foundation:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: to:lindsay@bitcoinfoundation.org</div><div class="quote">Hi BTC Foundation...<br /><br />Could you folk maybe pick up the stale application for a Unicode BitCoin symbol?&nbsp; Someone needs to do it, and you folk are perhaps best placed.<br /><br />http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc-minutes/UTC-127-201105.html<br /><br />Thursday, May 12, 2011 <br />Scripts and Symbols — Bitcoin Sign (C.14)<br />[127-A57] Action item for Rick McGowan: Respond to the author of L2/11-129 that the use of the bitcoin symbol in (running) text has not been demonstrated. There may also be IP issues because bitcoin.org is using the symbol as a logo.<br /><br />http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/11-129<br /><br />https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=bitcoin&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;domains=unicode.org&amp;sitesearch=unicode.org<br /><br />I&#039;m sure the suggestion of possible IP issues can be quickly resolved.&nbsp; The running text one will be interesting - because Bitcoin and keyboards go together - perhaps the evidence of people using BTC as a proxy for a symbol would suffice, especially in the context of using OTHER major currency unicode chars (€$£¥) and various discussion on fora about the need for a symbol will get close.&nbsp; <br />Also, maybe some of the BTC wallet / voucher printing site use the B in context?<br /><br />Anyway, hope you&#039;ll consider it.&nbsp; I was somewhat surprised to see that an application to Unicode has already been made, and considered, and faltered perhaps just for the lack of a response to a query by the applicant.</div><br />And just for the example, according to XE.COM,&nbsp; currently $1.00 = <span class="BTC">BTC</span>0.0101174<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also sent an e-mail to Lindsey, suggesting that they create a TeX package that can be used in documents now even before there is an official unicode symbol. e.g.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">\usepackage[Pander]{bitcoin}<br /></div><br />would then let us do<br /><br />The item costs 3.45 \bitcoin{}<br /><br />and it would insert the design by Pander.<br /><br />Or if we prefer the Wareen design -<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">\usepackage[Wareen]{bitcoin}<br /></div><br />The package would use postscript fonts designed by a font designer. It doesn&#039;t have to have an actual unicode number to be used in LaTeX.<br /><br />That would less us play with the different options helping us determine which we prefer. And when there is an official character, the TeX macro package could be updated so that all we have to do is recompile the document and the official character is used.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">slightly off-topic but can anyone point me to the exact font which was used for this graphic? Or was it &quot;hand&quot; drawn? Does anyone know the closest font? Bookman Old and Rockwell make a similar B but not exactly like it.<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/File:BC_Logo_.png</div>
