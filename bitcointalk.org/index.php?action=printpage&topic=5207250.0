					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dude... Sounds like you had too much coffee. I admit I haven&#039;t read all your quotes in context yet, but it seems you are also angry at Lauda (or something)... <br /><br />If you check my ref link for the trust I left him, he&#039;s doing a good thing. I&#039;ll be leaving that there regardless, as that&#039;s my option - If you want to teach him something, you can try and do it.... ::)</div>

I just wanted to make sure that campaign participants will be paid and Lauda almost agreed on escrowing their funds (I do not know what happened between them at the end) But it seems that I made a huge mistake, because I guess they are not going to run any campaign. Anyway, as I stated in my previous post, I am out of that deal forever and they can do whatever they want. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LOL at mosprognoz his scam hunting is a JOKE. Those 2 bit scammers that pop up the next day do nothing. <br /><br />I know a scamhunter that broke the biggest scam here, a scam that would have knocked bitcoin from top spot. He then forced them to offer a 2 000 000 000 dollar airdrop to the community and branded them an instamine scam forever. That is just ONE of the huge scams he was the first to break.<br /><br />Guess what mosprognoz you pathetic lauda serving weasel. The scammer supporter pushing this HUGE scam was LAUDA your scamming pal who you include on DT. The same scammer you stroking up shady escrowing for right now.<br /><br />OHHH I made a mistake. LOL if you&#039;re that fucking stupid to call yourself a scam hunter &nbsp;but including the biggest scammer/extorter here on DT and being pals with him and other proven scammers like tman then just delete your account and do the board a favor.<br /><br />LOL own up who is else is jealous of mosprognoz?? hahahahahah who would like a mosprognoz autograph tshirt. Scam hunter legend of bitcointalk lololol<br /><br /><br />If this account is not a lauda sock, then it may as well be one. More scammer supporter and enabler than scam hunter.<br /><br />Finding tiny 2 bit scammers that just pop up again is POINTLESS. The amount of btc a cunning ICO will rip out of people is 100x every scammer DT ever busted combined. DT members have zero experience with the alt board and the ones that do ARE THE SCAMMERS that are on DT.<br /><br />Suchmoon is perhaps the ONLY dt that has ever helped faced down a reasonable sized scammer the rest of the faux scam hunters are just a running joke to the REAL scam hunters of real note who made a real difference here.<br /><br />You have demonstrated in this debacle how you will collude with lauda and shady schemes, Get these turd world dregs off DT ffs.<br /><br />If you are sucked in by the &quot; we will catch some small nobody scammers so we can scam big time and get away with it&quot; &nbsp;scumbags here, you are just as bad.<br /><br />Show many ANY scam hunter on CURRENTLY on DT that broken and pulled down a huge scam. I can show you some on DT that have pushed/promoted big scams that is for sure.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

Sadly I think that is most of them if not all <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>CORRECT</b></span>. If you are on DT you have a responsibility to make sure that those guilty of undeniable financially motivated wrong doing are not on default trust and there is a red mark on them or even better a flag.<br /><br />If you can demonstrate how that is not true, then have a go here dirty scam facilitator.

Bitcoin SV (aka korner) is one of the biggest trolls around, and seeing as how their main account is banned (https://bpip.org/profile.aspx?p=korner) already, I don&#039;t know why their Bitcoin SV account hasn&#039;t been banned yet.</div>
