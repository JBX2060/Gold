					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi,<br /><br />I had some Bitcoin on my Electrum wallet. I transferred a very small amount to Binance. When I checked my Electrum wallet, nearly all of the Bitcoin was gone. I checked the Blockchain and there were three transactions from my Electrum wallet address. Two of them were small and went to Binance. However, there was another transaction at exactly the same time which transferred nearly all of the BTC in my wallet to an address that I do not recognise. What&#039;s happened? </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Should not be a problem... Your wallet created a new address and send the rest of your coins to that address. As soon as it confirms you should see your btc again.</div>
