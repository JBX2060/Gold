					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi there!<br /><br />I use to mine bitcoins for a while with EclipseMC and I had about 37 BTC stored in my account there.&nbsp; Well I was going to cash them out, but accidentally hit the cash out button sooner than I meant to and they were sent to my address.<br /><br />Well it has been a very long time since I used my bitcoin wallet and so the blockchain it has is very outdated.&nbsp; I currently have it updating the blockchain, but it has been running for 24 hours and still has about 10,000 blocks to go.&nbsp; And it&#039;s getting slower the closer it gets.&nbsp; I&#039;m only getting about 8-9 connections and the version I&#039;m using is 0.3.23-beta.&nbsp; I know I need to update the version, but I&#039;m worried that I&#039;ll lose my address and the transaction that&#039;s in progress.&nbsp; Btw, I&#039;ve already backed up my wallet.dat, but I don&#039;t think it will do much good since my bitcoins have not arrived yet.<br /><br />Is there any way to speed up the updating of the blockchain?&nbsp; (I did the port-forwarding for the firewall, but I&#039;m not exactly sure if I did it correctly.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The coins don&#039;t have to arrive in your wallet.dat. &nbsp;They just need to get listed in the public blockchain.<br /><br />As long as you have a backup of your wallet.dat, you&#039;re fine. &nbsp;Go ahead and update to the latest.<br /><br />You can also download a recent blockchain here: &nbsp;http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/blockchain/ (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/blockchain/)<br /><br />However, make sure you run with -rescan the first time so it&#039;ll find your coins.<br /><br />Edit: fixed URL</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you have a backup of your wallet.dat which contains the address you sent them to there is absolutely no risk of losing coins. &nbsp;It will take a very long time to download the blockchain but that is to be expected. &nbsp;0.3.23 is ancient any particularly reason you are still using that? worst case scenario you can export the private key from your wallet.dat and import it into another wallet. &nbsp;<br /><br />As Revalin indicated coins don&#039;t go to your client. &nbsp;The go the blockchain (alll 20,000+ nodes all around the planet). &nbsp;Your wallet.dat simply contains the keys which let you (and only you) spend/transfer coins you have received. &nbsp; You don&#039;t need to be online, or have a client up to date, or even have a computer to receive bitcoins.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, the sourceforge blockchain is only to block 170k. &nbsp;If you&#039;re already within 10k blocks of finished then there&#039;s no point in downloading it again.<br /><br />All you have to do is exit, update to 0.6.2, then fire it up again. &nbsp;It will pick up where it left off.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">10 is plenty.&nbsp; The update is usually limited by the speed of your CPU and disk, not the number of connections.<br /><br />0.6.2 should update faster than 0.3.23.&nbsp; Just give it a bit.</div>
