					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve had a few unconfirmed SatoshiDice bets for a couple weeks. My bitcoin wallet is fully updated and the blockchain is fully downloaded. I tried looking up the transactions in Blockchain and SatoshiDice, with no results. It&#039;s almost as if the transaction hasn&#039;t been broadcast, although when I&#039;ve had that in the past it said (Not Broadcast) beside the transaction.<br /><br />I tried PMing evorhees (Owner of SatoshiDice), and he kinda blew me off with &#039;There&#039;s no proof of the transaction&#039;. I asked him what the acceptable methods of giving proof were, and no reply. This is a very real problem, I have 22BTC tied up in this glitch. That&#039;s $235 USD.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what to do here. If it&#039;s a problem with SatoshiDice, it looks like I&#039;m SOL. Could it be a client side bug? How would I go about resetting my bitcoin client without losing these &#039;in limbo&#039; transactions?<br /><br />Screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/UTa4X<br />SatoshiDice Links to transactions: <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.5 BTC bets</span><br />1. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=eb68ffbcc9b7b032f8b7716a5efed4a5440372b5007b7e88e76931ed1e19adc0<br />2. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=12449e6e3786d153f47d511fdae35da157c7f79428816857ea16df00371e97b2<br />3. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=106308e0b2f70aac959545ab91ae9d3200969b6fb1cf8a4734b0a3945939885e<br />4. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=ed63bd2052588d4e764d2ebbf933990a48ce24f1adffc5b6cf13fb3e4aefbc72<br />5. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=5f47d2946054d3c73478f2f79fe8a4f5d88f05cba40586a8005cbdbf8db94f0b<br />6. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=94e3e903796cdc3a6685a3038b7651451c0c36c4fef4c797efce3d8571cc2dc4<br />7. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=44af18a085e79fe30da5b1e5e1985c140a52a72bcbebab25624344bad5b8b2b1<br />8. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=7316fc156e50dc49114edd57b725ef6dae613ef57b7ffe2def118144809137ca<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 BTC bets</span><br />1. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=dd46711aa5a24f90ccc995e6aafd713f3009f0077650379dd476cdf6ea951343<br />2. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=158d3c490498d8958134519a01eb0a316f1b86f2d836bc1b3a18ff0479bd92ed<br />3. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=1edcfde2ddc8e3e93788dd764e1a7cdef4bf6d7fc9e3e906c946429aa5128624<br />4. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=a722dc1b39c3ef411d4f9d2231b5a0348a2afa1744dd42af816b12782232e8fc<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 BTC bets</span><br />1. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=ed45098b21b64827443e98def0386487f6e4f47f2e1cc1385e1883f43106214a<br />2. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=e82c3b5f38f516040464113184aebd733ff9f64cd3d222eae05e00bb2a3d3811<br />3. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=217a29946c9331a7276f92d6cf0bc1221d52c8e2d47c94b4a280043c6e300980<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8 BTC bet</span><br />1. http://www.satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=8c8a85846b2c2e28abe5e96c00d7a24c7a97c6b84f4577445a040a6208571395<br /></div>

Gox&#039;s &quot;upload wallet.dat&quot; method and let that redeem your funds for you into your account. <br /><br /></div>

Configure bitcoin.conf with rpcuser=, rpcpassword= and server= so that you can access the API from command line bitcoind.<br /><br />2.) Run bitcoind &nbsp;(or Bitcoin-qt with -server )<br /><br />3.) <br />&nbsp;$ ~/bin/bitcoind -rpcuser=myuser -rpcpassword=mypassword listaccounts<br /><br />for each of those accounts, do a getaddressesbyaccount. &nbsp;For example, for the default account (&quot;&quot;):<br /><br />&nbsp;$ ~/bin/bitcoind -rpcuser=myuser -rpcpassword=mypassword getaddressesbyaccount &quot;&quot;<br /><br />Then get the private key (dumpprivkey ) for each of those addresses. &nbsp;e.g., for 1PC9aZC4hNX2rmmrt7uHTfYAS3hRbph4UN do:<br /><br />&nbsp;./bitcoind -rpcuser=myuser -rpcpassword=mypassword dumpprivkey &nbsp;1PC9aZC4hNX2rmmrt7uHTfYAS3hRbph4UN<br /><br /><br />4.) Then with the new, empty wallet, do the same steps 1-3. &nbsp;then importprivkey for each.<br /><br /><br />Now this can be automated with a script if needed. &nbsp;Also if you have wallet encryption enabled, you&#039;ll need to issue the RPC command walletpassphrase &nbsp;to make it so subsequent commands are accepted /<br /><br />5.) Remove or replace bitcoin.conf so that you aren&#039;t leaving RPC enabled if you weren&#039;t previously using it.<br /><br />This is not something non-technical people are expected to need to do. &nbsp; You may wish to contract with someone (reputable) recover these funds. From an export of the addresses it can be determined how much in unspent funds you have in that wallet.&nbsp; As far as a possible explanation of how this scenario you are in could happen, see issue #1428:<br />&nbsp;- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1428<br /></div>

You&#039;re pretty reputable, would you be willing to recover these double spends? I&#039;d be willing to pay you 2BTC if you&#039;re successful. <br /><br />Let me know what you think.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Woooooop, good news, Success!<br /><br />Despite what I said in my PM yesterday, I decided to take a second look at that wallet.<br />First I deleted the stuck transactions with pywallet and started bitcoin-qt with the -rescan option, didn&#039;t work.<br />Then I decided to delete all transactions (thx to this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=102331.0),<br />started bitcoin-qt with -rescan again .... and there it is, balance shows: 23.67660791 BTC &nbsp;;D<br /><br />I will upload the wallet to my server and then send you the download link in a PM (may take some time, my internet is slooooow)<br /></div>
