					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Blockchain.info is the one I would recommend.<br /><br />I am also a heavy advocate of using paper wallets (such as ones you can print from BitAddress.org). &nbsp;I don&#039;t leave bitcoins online and any time I transact in bitcoins, I physically grab the coins I need, transact in them, and send the change to another paper wallet. &nbsp;That way, the only coins I ever risk getting stuck anywhere are the ones I&#039;m working with at the moment, and with BlockChain.info I believe I&#039;m not likely to get my coins stuck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">guys... since bitcoin-qt 0.7.0 you can send RPC commands using the Console on the Debug Window...<br />No need to mess with bitcoin.conf to make it run as a server.<br />Also, recommending pywallet for someone who will need to export a couple private keys is a bit overkill lol<br /></div>
