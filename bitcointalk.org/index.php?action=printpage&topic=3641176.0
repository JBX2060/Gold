Higher ROI to Advertisers<br />B. More revenue to Publishers<br /><br />Here are some unique things about the NOIZ Ad network:<br />1. Upto 30% engagement recorded with AI based banners that are more engaging and let advertisers interact with potential customers in a semi automated way<br />2. More targeted ads using permission-based blockchain that protects user privacy, while keeping the targeting parameters exposed to advertisers (and users get paid for sharing their data)<br />3. Community consensus powered quality control - You control who plays in this Ad Network (so, if you think a publisher is spreading fake news or FUDs, or an Advertiser is promoting gun laws, or an ICO should be allowed and others banned... just vote them IN or OUT)</div>

The main purpose for the crowdfunding is to build a global ad community (giving control back to the people). This would not only disrupt other ad networks/exchanges but also our own partner companies. Right now, though, we are only operational in Hong Kong, so the crowdfunding will help us expand internationally and develop a product that is truly impactful.</div>

They were annoying, you clicked on one in every 100, and they became the victims of &quot;banner blindness.&quot; Today, digital advertising is vast, with many different types of online ads being produced based on target audience, website content, and call to action. And it&#039;s like every technology nowdays which is widening with every passing day.</div>

NOIZ has been received well and rated on some of the best ICO directories. We think the project is promising because:<br />1. We already have a distribution in Ad space (30 M / month) with some of the top banks and automotive companies in Hong Kong, China<br />2. We have an indepth industry experience and supported by amazing blockchain and AI eperts. <br /><br />But the reason we like the most is:<br />3. NOIZ gives the control of Ad networks back to the community. We, as people decide who participates and who doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Since community is incharge, scandals like Cambridge Analytica and Ad networks banning cryptocurrencies or ICOs doesn&#039;t happen on NOIZ.</div>

Yes, you can transfer from your whitelisted wallet address. Just make sure your wallet can receive ERC20 compatible tokens (like MyEtherWallet). Your Exchange wallet will not work. <br /><br />Current price is 1 ETH = 3000 NOIZ tokens.

But what if I told you NOIZ is better than that, here is how:<br /><br />On NOIZ, users:<br />1. Earn tokens for interacting with Ads that matter to them and interact with their famous brands<br />2. Earn airdrops by Advertisers EVERY SINGLE DAY, which can be used as coupon tokens, which can be used to try out / purchase their products<br />3. Can choose to exchange the same airdrops for offers at other advertisers they like, Donate it to their favorite NGO or CAUSE or exchange those over on DEXs<br /><br />You see, a daily bonus is better than a monthly bonus, right? And Advertises can target the airdrop based upon how many NOIZ tokens you hold (just an indicator that you are a better quality lead for them). Best part is, NOIZ doesnt control the process of monthly bonus... its again the community of Advertisers playing and allowed by community... who does.<br /><br /></div>

We ensure all of your budget is used to engage real users and we provide crystal clear data to support it. <br /><br />As a User, you control what data you share with the Publisher and the Advertiser, and you get paid for it in NOIZ tokens! <br /><br />If you would like to find out more about how our platform will benefit all parties, please visit our YouTube channel and watch our explanatory videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8SOjT2H9jCddqs3F9-VQ4g<br /><br /></div>

Once the NOIZ platform is out, the cognitive ad will be integrated with the blockchain system, combining great UI with rewards-based system for interaction. We are positive that this will result in much greater user engagement. <br /><br />If you have more questions, don&#039;t forget to chat to us on our Telegram channel: t.me/noizchainenglish<br /></div>

Can you elaborate on how exactly you want to achieve this?<br /></div><br />Hi gametiny, <br /><br />We will be combining AI and Blockchain systems to make sure spambot traffic cannot skew marketing data in the NOIZ ad exchange. There a couple of ways in which this will be achieved: <br /><br />Nikola (our cognitive ad) has the ability to discover which user interactions are bot-like, and which resemble humans. The bot-like activities data will be filtered out of the system and never included in reports. <br /><br />The interaction data will be hashed onto the blockchain and available directly to users, advertisers and publishers. By using blockchain, we ensure that advertisers have access to accurate data about their ads, publishers don&#039;t have to worry about data leakage (because we will be using Hyperledger) and users control exactly how much data they are giving out by interacting with the ad. <br /><br />If you would like some more in-depth explanations, please take a look at our explanatory videos on our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8SOjT2H9jCddqs3F9-VQ4g?</div>

Users are also able to choose what standard data is sent to advertisers, protecting private information they do not wish to share.<br /><br />If you have more questions, feel free to chat with us on our Telegram channel: t.me/noizchainenglish<br /><br /><br /></div>

If any bots are operating on the NOIZ network, such bots would likely try to pool all the NOIZ tokens in one single exchange/wallet; they would likely never donate/vote for actors in the NOIZ economy; and they likely wouldn&#039;t exhibit engagement patterns that match with other humans. <br /><br />NOIZ can prevent such ad fraud by using Run-Time Execution Monitoring, which recognizes actions of bots and distinguishes them from real users. The NOIZ network will also host investigative bots to continuously monitor the NOIZ token transaction flow on randomly selected wallets, to see patterns related to any bots that may be operating on the network. Finally, NOIZ uses a cognitive bot named NIKOLA to initiate conversation dialogues within each ad, and can classify consumer responses - their engagement - into a level of Intent system and deliver tokens through the NOIZ platform. <br /><br />If you have more questions on our project, feel free to chat with us on our Telegram channel: t.me/noizchainenglish<br /></div>

This is because programmatic ad buying generates higher ROI. However centralized ad platforms are also notorious for double standards in regards to the ads and advertisers they wish to support or ban. Certain advertisers may be left high and dry depending on the industries in which they operate. <br /><br />NOIZ provides a solution to this problem by having consensus based white/black listing advertisers and publishers based upon their business model and performance. NOIZ is a completely new digital ad exchange platform that will revamp the entire advertising ecosystem! <br /><br />If you have more questions on our project, feel free to join us on our Telegram channel:&nbsp; t.me/noizchainenglish<br /></div>

Unfortunately, this method of fundraising is very prone to scams.<br /><br />A simple analogy can be drawn between the well-known initial public offering (IPO) and an ICO. In an IPO, fiat currency is exchanged for shares by investors, whereas in an ICO funds are raised when a quantity of the crowdfunded cryptocurrency is sold to investors in the form of “coins” or “tokens,” in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum.<br /><br />These tokens are promoted as future functional units of currency in the project environment if or when the funding goal is met and the project launches. Due to their relative newness, the regulatory environment concerning ICOs and cryptocurrencies is still evolving and the inherent nature of an ICO also renders them susceptible to scams. A majority of projects behind ICOs do not present a functioning product or service before the ICO.<br /><br />According to research by Ernst &amp; Young, over 10 percent of funds raised by a sample of 370 ICOs were lost or stolen in hacker attacks. Given the ease with which scam ICOs can be set up by fraudsters, investors should be cautious before making an investment.<br />https://medium.com/@NOIZchain/tips-from-the-noiz-team-how-to-avoid-ico-scams-51546a908b57</div>

I hope that this whole situation will change in the near future for the better, as it discourages many potential new investors.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of the main purposes of NOIZchain is to change the advertising ecosystem by building up consumer awareness.<br />In the past few years, private data leakage has become a significantly increasing problem. NOIZ wants to establish a transparent ad space, where consumers will have the control. This type of advertising model will protect the consumers from malignant advertisers and publishers, but also empower genuine advertisers. In an effort to achieve this, the engineers at NOIZ have built an AI-enabled, decentralized ad network. It is planned to be fully operable by the end of 2019 and revolutionize the way we look at brand-consumer relations.<br /><br />http://www.pulseico.com/noizchain-re-engineered-advertising-network/<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Guys, checkout some unique features of NOIZchain, they include:<br /><br />Peer to Peer (P2P) Advertising – NOIZ intends to be a fully P2P marketplace where publishers and advertisers will be able to connect directly with one another and make agreements powered by a smart contract platform.<br /><br />Peer to Peer Consumer Marketplace – consumers decide which data and with whom they want to share data, and are rewarded with tokens for sharing data with advertisers and publishers.<br /><br />Coupons and Redemption – NOIZ tokens work like coupons on the advertiser’s website. The advertiser sets up the smart contract and determines the necessary requirements the customer has to meet to redeem tokens.<br /><br />Consensus-Based for All Parties – Just like a consensus would decide if a certain product or advertisement is beneficial to the community or marketplace; in the same consumers, advertisers, and publishers would decide on activities.<br /></div>
