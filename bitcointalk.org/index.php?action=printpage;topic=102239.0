					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From the outside Obama seems to have been a rather kick ass president.<br />People are always gonna be pissed of with whoever&#039;s in power.<br />We all expect our leaders to look after us specifically, who cares about the rest of the population.<br />Besides being blamed for the wall street crash what else stands against everyone revoting for him?<br /><br />It may be opposition propaganda, but it does seem like Romney will say anything to get elected.<br />And he seems to think he&#039;s smarter than the entire country:<br />You want to see my tax returns? You&#039;ll have to elect me first.</div>

Check your state&#039;s rules. Some don&#039;t count write-ins. If your state doesn&#039;t Gary Johnson is on the ballet in all 50 states.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, Johnson isn&#039;t going to win but I&#039;m going to vote for him anyway. It&#039;ll at least send a message that maybe a few people will hear.<br /><br />Romney isn&#039;t going to win either. A vote for him is just pointless. (I do admit a very tiny chance that Obama screws up massively several times causing a Romney win, but the likelihood is so small I&#039;d rather chance money on the lottery.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The most important issues to me are not addressed by either mainstream candidate:<br /><br /><br />1) Balancing the budget (especially through cutting defense spending). (Romney/Ryan does not even pretend to plan to balance the budget for many decades)<br />2) End the drug war.<br />3) Stop using the tax system to micromanage everyone&#039;s lives, trying to pressure them into taking out student debt, getting married, having kids, buying a house, etc. Replace the current tax system with one that can be explained with no more than 100 pages.<br />4) Stop invading other countries.<br />5) Respect civil liberties, the need for warrants for all searches, the prohibition on torture, and due process.<br />6) Ending legal tender laws<br /><br />I am voting for Johnson.</div>

It&#039;s a comfortable thought that he can get the blame and then be forced to pay pennance by,say, going on tv every day to apologise, thus reminding everyone all the time and driving the message home. The reality, unfortunately is vastly different. Take the UK, for example. After years of a socialist party dominance, the finances have been left in tatters and the country changed by thousands of inane laws that are designed to criminalise everyone. The main players have been blamed and found responsible but no action will ever realistically be taken. They are all now sitting pretty in jobs-for-the-boys.<br />&nbsp;<br />The new bunch took over (not much difference) and a couple of years on, people are crying that they want the old bunch back again because the new ones are giving away less free stuff. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />My point is that people have incredibly short memories and won&#039;t demand or be serious about blame and consequence as long as there is still electricity to run their gadgets and meat comes in nice plastic packaging from a convenient supermarket. There needs to be an immense fark up on a huge scale, enough to seriously disrupt the status quo and turn the emperor&#039;s clothes to cinders.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Worth noting there are thresholds third parties must meet to receive automatic ballot access. This varies by state, but generally requires a .5%-10% showing. Without obtaining this, candidates generally need tens or hundreds of thousands of signatures in each state way before the election, which dries up third-party candidates&#039; coffers faster than they can replenish at such an early stage.<br /><br />Third-party presidential candidates don&#039;t have a chance in &#039;12, but they do have the ability to allow future candidates to actually spend resources on campaigning instead of paying swarms of people to collect enough signatures to get on a ballot. That&#039;s good for spreading ideas, and looks to be the best to reasonably hope for within the next couple decades. As is, state laws have more-or-less created a duopoly for Dems and Reps. Though... I think the USG is too far gone at this point, and there are plenty of opportunities to spread liberty faster than reversing government control over our lives through politics, and I think the % of US citizens not voting speaks more powerfully than a relatively good run by a LP pres. candidate in a particular year... though this assumes the candidates will spend a very large chunk of resources just buying signatures. Third parties, I found in 2008, appear to frequently bicker about trivial shit, too -- drama in politics, which itself is pretty much glorified drama - not a very productive environment.</div>

Bidding in the name of business could help the economy. Obama taxed business higher, with the theory that we get more money from them.

Instead of taking a business for a ride with taxes, it would be better to get a smaller amount from MANY more businesses.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So you hope for Romney to cut taxes on businesses and the rich in an effort to balance the budget via increased economic activity and therefore increased tax revenue?<br /><br />1) He is not directly in control of this. Levying taxes is up to congress.<br />2) If they tax less they will just borrow more.<br />3) What taxes will be cut by how much, and which businesses do you expect this to bring back to america? How long will it take to get these tax cuts through, and how long until the businesses return?</div>

If your association with the entity is voluntary, it has no regional monopoly on the acceptable use of force, so it&#039;s not a state.<br /><br />The key difference between AnCap and other systems is that entities don&#039;t have socially-accepted regional monopolies on the accepted use of force. One of the ways people commonly try to refute AnCap systems is to show that they would inevitably soon result in such monopolies and thus AnCap is unstable. If such an argument were accepted, that would refute AnCap as a political system.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In 2008, Obama ran on a campaign largely centered around the idea of &quot;hope and change&quot; and that these things were possible with current political structuring. Today most of us realize this is an utter and blatant contrived farse; the smile of a politician, wrapped in succulent lie tainted bacon. And I like my bacon, don&#039;t go tainting it!<br />Ahem, I digress. More recently in September 2012 during the Democratic National Convention, Obama states to the public that &quot;The change is <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you!<i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></i></span></i>&quot;... and as mind-blowing as this is, it&#039;s only a half truth. For hope to be viable and plausible, you must first believe in it, and fewer people are, as the days of bitter monetary oppression continue to pass. I was taught long ago that change, no matters its form, comes from within. The vast majority of people are not &quot;from within&quot;, quite the contrary, for the most part we are unenlightened sheep who remain docile just as our oppressors would wish us to be. We have no ability to change the system from within because there is no political will to do so. People are much happier just living their lives and not rocking the proverbial boat. <br />If change is to occur, it must happen on the level of social-elitists who think themselves better than their fellow man just because of some relatively worthless fancy green ink printed on equally fancy paper. Problem is, the rich have 1 priority above all else, and that is to remain rich. Not easy to &quot;rock the boat&quot; with that crowd, but if we are to free ourselves from financial tyranny, I feel this is an absolutely necessary step along the way. Convince the rich that they will no longer be rich if they put so much faith in a dying currency. Not all voices are equal in this country, far from it. The more money you have, the more power you have, the more power you have, the more influence you have, etc etc etc... Do not believe a word that any politician would choose to have seeded in your ear, for behind that word is some unknown clandestine agenda which will likely come back and haunt you from your early grave for having listened. Voting one way or the other is another way of saying &quot;I&#039;m okay with being told half-truths and empty promises by corrupt entities over whom I have zero control.&quot; Politics are a rigged game, the house wins either way, be they Republicrat or Democans. There is but one way and one way only to beat a rigged game; don&#039;t play it. Don&#039;t vote. Watch as the powers that be realize how utterly fucked they are when only 1% of the population goes out to vote.<br /><br />Don&#039;t fuck with my bacon.</div>

That is a bold faced lie! Romney wants military spending at 4% of GDP, which is certainly higher than it is now. These blatant lies piss me off soooooo fucking much.</div>

Obama could hardly even be called a progressive. The only real difference between Obama and Romney is black and white.... or blue and red - the rest is all marketing. One wants to continue (and/or has a history of continuing) social and corporate welfare, while expanding military adventurism, and the other wants to continue (and/or has a history of continuing) social and corporate welfare, while expanding military adventurism - and neither has a comprehensive plan to pay for these programs (less &quot;by 2020, my plan will have eliminated our deficit... (but when the people who aren&#039;t grandfathered into their welfare being cut are about to feel it, politicians revert, and nothing changes.&quot;). - And that&#039;s not even the worst of it. When these fucks are compromising, the end product is corporatism -- government funding select corporations for welfare/warfare handouts... because having the government do the work is &quot;Communism,&quot; so that&#039;s the great accomplishment Republicans have given the US: instead of citizens paying the government to direct money, citizens pay the government to pay the corporations to direct money. Great. I swear - the only thing going for Obama is that he isn&#039;t Romney - and the only thing going for Romney is that he isn&#039;t Obama. We&#039;ve got this.... fucking......... - and..... ugh - out of whiskey, again.</div>

Obama could hardly even be called a progressive. The only real difference between Obama and Romney is black and white.... or blue and red - the rest is all marketing. One wants to continue (and/or has a history of continuing) social and corporate welfare, while expanding military adventurism, and the other wants to continue (and/or has a history of continuing) social and corporate welfare, while expanding military adventurism - and neither has a comprehensive plan to pay for these programs (less &quot;by 2020, my plan will have eliminated our deficit... (but when the people who aren&#039;t grandfathered into their welfare being cut are about to feel it, politicians revert, and nothing changes.&quot;). - And that&#039;s not even the worst of it. When these fucks are compromising, the end product is corporatism -- government funding select corporations for welfare/warfare handouts... because having the government do the work is &quot;Communism,&quot; so that&#039;s the great accomplishment Republicans have given the US: instead of citizens paying the government to direct money, citizens pay the government to pay the corporations to direct money. Great. I swear - the only thing going for Obama is that he isn&#039;t Romney - and the only thing going for Romney is that he isn&#039;t Obama. We&#039;ve got this.... fucking......... - and..... ugh - out of whiskey, again.<br /></div><br />Obama is almost as republican as Regan.&nbsp; Even the healthcare plan so many are calling &#039;commie/socialism&#039; is to the right of Regan proposals.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>

I have never witnessed anything to make me think illegals do anymore of any type of crime than anyone else. Actually, the majority of the entitled people who think they will not be caught are generally white people that I would meet (though there were not many) and I don&#039;t think I saw a single black or asian person in the town. My wife is mexican, none of her family is illegal, but the amount of ignorance I see from people in relation to illegals is staggering. The people who believe and repeat the stereotypes of illegals being lazy, lawbreakers are usually like my backasswards family in Georgia. And the type of idiotic things I hear them say are &quot;Hey those mexicans (they were not mexican, probably puerto ricans taller darker) are stealing all our watermelons ( they had just harvested their leased field in GA).&quot; <br /><br />Ideas like this make me want to punch a baby since the word illegals is a replacement word for mexican usually. And most of these ignorant backwoods people forget that there is no such thing as white. Where does your family come from? Oh they were immigrants? Did they get here legally? What country? Oh your german so you must be &quot;pure blood nazi&quot; right? My wife is Mexican, but is not really, shes whiter than me and has more spaniard blood than anything, shoot her grandmother was white as a ghost with red hair. I am cherokee indian, german, scottish, welsh, which means I am closer to mexican than she is since I have cherokee which were at least on the same continent as mexico before her family moved there.<br /><br />Generalizations do not reinforce a point, you should say according to this source: http://wikipedia.org illegal aliens from xxxx country tend to perpatrate crime in border cities at an alarmingly higher rate. I disagree with the whole concept. Lazy has nothing to do with it, go look up the laws to apply for citizenship, they are nuts and they require the immigrant to learn things people born here with college degrees never learned in school.</div>

I mean even the supposedly bad president GWB only increased the debt by 4.4T in 8 years, and he fought 2 wars.<br /></div><br />What the heck is AA? &nbsp;Alcoholics &nbsp;Anonymous? &nbsp;<br /><br />The level of Illegals we have are good for the economy (we may not have enough right now) and contrary to media reports commit fewer crimes then average. <br /><br />The debt should be cut. &nbsp;Neither has a realistic plan for dealing with it. &nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />AA is Affirmative Action, this issue has a pretty big supreme court case going on right now, I thought everyone would know it. Google &quot;affirmative action supreme court case&quot;<br /><br />The vast majority of the illegals are low skill/manual labor population, they can only do manual labor. It&#039;s unfair that a Ph.D/Master student can not easily obtain green card (which Romney has proposed to allow these people obtain Green card, google &#039;advanced degree green card romney&#039;), while Obama propose to legalize these manual laborers. The United States did not become great due to manual labor, it became great due to all the advanced science/technology it has. Why are barbers in China paid $1 for haircut, while barbers in the US are paid $10? because the barber in the US serve a population that has created science/technology that China can not match, NOT because some illegal Mexican can mow lawns for cheap (which is still expensive compared to Chinese labor).<br /><br />As for the debt, Obama squanders money because he has zero business experience nor management experience (all he has ever been was lawyer or senator). Romney on the other hand has almost 30 years of business experience, several successful turnarounds (bain capital, winter olympics) and is known to be good with money. What&#039;s important is not what the &quot;plan&quot; is, but experience. When you go to job interviews, does the company care more about your &quot;plan&quot; or do they care more about your experience? As long as you have the necessary experience, you will have the plan and you will make it work. Without the necessary experience, any &quot;plan&quot; you speak of, I would be highly skeptical of it.<br /></div>

Removing income tax and capital gains tax likewise would improve the economy by not punishing earning and saving. Student loans do indeed increase tuition, much the same way widespread medical insurance increases medical costs. I&#039;m not well versed on his position on that, but I feel private loans would be acceptable, but government loans and grants would not.<br /><br />As for the sales tax not being &quot;fair,&quot; how is 23% of all purchases, across the board, to everyone, not fair? Should the rich pay larger percentages in taxes, just because they have more money? They&#039;d already be paying more in raw numbers. A poor person buying a pack of ramen would pay $1.23, while a rich person buying a tin of caviar would pay $123.00 That&#039;s $23.00 in tax instead of $0.23. Seems plenty &quot;fair&quot; to me. <br /><br />I, of course, am not in favor of any taxes, but if there must be tax, you can&#039;t get more fair than a sales tax.<br /><br />I&#039;d like some clarification on one point, though... How, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span> is opening the borders &quot;just... insane&quot;?</div>

Should the rich pay larger percentages in taxes, just because they have more money? They&#039;d already be paying more in raw numbers. A poor person buying a pack of ramen would pay $1.23, while a rich person buying a tin of caviar would pay $123.00 That&#039;s $23.00 in tax instead of $0.23. Seems plenty &quot;fair&quot; to me. <br /><br />I, of course, am not in favor of any taxes, but if there must be tax, you can&#039;t get more fair than a sales tax.<br /><br />I&#039;d like some clarification on one point, though... How, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span> is opening the borders &quot;just... insane&quot;?<br /></div><br />Sorry but if you are seriously thinking that &quot;open borders&quot; is not insane, you are seriously out of touch with reality. There&#039;s basically billions of people in the world that would kill to be living in America, once you open your borders, these people will rush in, now instead of tens of millions of unskilled illegals, you&#039;ll have hundreds of millions, or even billions. That&#039;s a quick path to disaster-ville.<br /><br />With a 23% sales tax, the rich are not really paying the same percentage. Because not all rich person spends a lot, many of them don&#039;t. For example Warren Buffet, his life style is very modest. He would be basically paying a 0.1% tax rate on his income, he simply does not spend that much money to buy things. Plus even if the rich person do spend a lot, like I said he still only buys 1 bed to sleep on, unless his bed is 1000 times more expensive than the average joe&#039;s, he&#039;s not paying his fair share. If I was Warren Buffet, I&#039;d quickly run out of things to buy to achieve even a 5% tax rate, because even a rich person simply does not need 1000 beds or 1000 toilets.<br /><br />Basically, to implement a 23% sales tax, you&#039;ll have to look at who are the consumers of the majority of the product in this country? if you find the rich consume majority of products in this country, then 23% sales tax will work. Unfortunately, the truth is the poor/middle class consume the majority of products in this country, not the rich, you&#039;ll just be shifting the vast majority of revenue burden on the backs of poor/middle class, and would be giving the rich a huge tax cut, one they don&#039;t really need. This would further increase the wealth gap. This path usually leads to violent revolution and forced wealth re-distribution, again a quick path to disaster-ville.</div>

That&#039;s a quick path to disaster-ville.<br /></div><br />You wouldn&#039;t have hundreds of millions of illegals, you would have hundreds of millions of <i>immigrants</i>. The time periods where the US has had lots of immigration have been some of the most prosperous times. And they&#039;re hardly all unskilled, either. Now, quit with the fear-mongering, and listen to some reason.<br /><br />As for the tax, yes, rich people can save more. You&#039;re neglecting the fact that with no income or capital gains taxes, the poor will also be able to save more. A minimum wage worker would, on average, get a 15-20% larger check. And you cannot deny that the rich consume more. because they consume more, they will be paying more taxes. <br /><br />Being rich, in itself, does not incur a debt to society. Unless that wealth was gotten illegitimately, any debt to society <i>has already been paid</i>, and the wealth is the visible result of paying that debt. Bill Gates, for instance. How did he get his money? Very likely, by putting the operating system that you&#039;re currently using onto your computer. (less likely here than elsewhere, but no less true for that) Bill Gates got his money by providing a product that people wanted. If nobody wanted any Microsoft products, Gates would be broke. The same is true for almost every rich person out there. They <i>got</i> rich by providing goods or services. If they had not <i>already</i> served society, they would not have the money. So stop being so jealous that you didn&#039;t provide those goods or services.<br /><br />Neither fear nor jealousy are pretty emotions, and you should not be displaying them so openly.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=102239.msg1274242#msg1274242">Quote from: SgtSpike on October 15, 2012, 08:09:07 PM</a></div><div class="quote">That makes sense.&nbsp; I&#039;d say that prisons should be governmentally funded and owned for the reasons you mentioned then.<br /></div><br />The problem is not the fact that the prisons are private.

Since they have no competition (and certainly, their &quot;customers&quot; get no choice in the matter), and their only obligation is to the shareholders, They don&#039;t have the prisoners&#039; best interests at heart.<br /><br />The solution, of course, is the same as any other industry dominated by a big monopoly that&#039;s fucking it&#039;s customers.

However, his own legal opinions justifying the drone strikes have never been released and he continues to refuse to release them.<br /><br />http://www.salon.com/2009/02/10/obama_88/<br />See this article for more on how Obama completely abandoned his most important campaign promise -- to end the abuses Bush started.<br /><br />(Of course, I certainly don&#039;t think a Romney administration would fix this.)<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LittleShop/JoelKatz<br /><br />If you were a one-issue voter, debt-reduction was your single issue, and you had to vote for Obama or Romney, who would you vote for?<br /><br />I&#039;m asking because I&#039;m legitimately curious. I was planning on not voting this election but decided that even though neither is a good candidate, their outlooks are sufficiently different that it *might* impact the debt situation.<br /><br />Just curious to hear what your opinions are, and anyone else who feels they have a well-researched opinion on the matter.<br /><br />As for me, I&#039;m weighing a four year period where Obama did nothing to address the $1 trillion dollar deficits he inherited from bush in his entire four year term, vs. Romney clearly lying about the net effect of his 20% across the board tax cut and his litmus test of &#039;not adding to the deficit&#039; as a freakishly low bar given our deficit spending rate these days.<br /><br />On the plus side for Romney, he did balance the budget in Mass. but its not as impressive as it sounds. Massachusetts, like most US states, has a balanced budget law that requires the budget to balance every year.<br /><br />Thoughts?</div>

Other loan interests aren&#039;t deductible but home mortgage interest is. Why isn&#039;t the special treatment for this one type of interest a loophole? But the point is that there is no objective test for whether something is a loophole. Roughly speaking, it&#039;s something that is given a special break relative to other things that are similar and objectively should have similar treatment perhaps as a social engineering way to encourage things, perhaps as a special gift to a privileged group. Objectively, home mortgage interest is essentially no different from credit card interest and there&#039;s no reason taxes should treat them differently.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Here are some example loopholes Romney closed in MA while he&#039;s governor:<br />* Removed tax shelter status for fake &quot;real estate lenders&quot;, (because banks were posing as real estate lenders to exploit this tax loophole)<br />* Computer software purchased in Massachusetts stores was subject to sales tax, but the same product downloaded from the Internet was not.</div>I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s a loophole that you pay Massachusetts tax for a purchase made in a store in Massachusetts but not for a purchase not made in a store in Massachusetts. If that&#039;s a &quot;loophole&quot; then so is mortgage interest being deductible if it&#039;s for a home but not for a car. At least in the sales tax case, it&#039;s the absence of a State nexus that controls taxability, not the product purchased.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">* Trusts were used as intermediaries in the sale of businesses to limit taxes on the transactions.<br />* Companies like WorldCom Inc., headquartered in low-tax states, charged subsidiaries located in MA royalty fees for business ideas coming from the home office.

So what *Federal* loopholes would he close?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Why he hasn&#039;t disclosed which loopholes he want to close on the Federal level? because that would be too easy for Obama to steal, Obama has already stolen his idea of &quot;closing loopholes&quot; shown by yesterday&#039;s debate.

Bluntly, it seems *impossible* -- they&#039;re just aren&#039;t the kinds of loopholes that would create enough revenue, other than loopholes that would hit the middle class and small businesses heavily.<br /><br />Is the earned income tax credit a &quot;loophole&quot;? I don&#039;t know if Romney considers it one. Is the home mortgage interest deduction a loophole in Romney&#039;s eyes? What about the self-employed health insurance deduction? Frankly, I have no idea what his plan is, and I can&#039;t reliably assess who it will help and who it will hurt. This is a huge *negative* against Romney to me.<br /></div>

These figures also do not include additional interest payments on the national debt that will result from higher deficits due to war spending.<br /><br />These numbers are based on an analysis of legislation in which Congress has allocated money for war and research by the Congressional Research Service (latest report) which has access to Department of Defense financial reports. <b>An article offered by the Strauss Military Reform Project of the Center for Defense Information offers greater insight into the problems of truly knowing how much has been spent on the Iraq War or other military operations.</b><br />&nbsp;<br />During the Bush administration, the majority of war funding was allocated through emergency supplementals. Beginning with the FY2010 budget, most of the war funding was included in the core budget appropriations process. In July 2010, Congress passed additional supplemental appropriations to fund the 30,000 troop surge in Afghanistan announced by President Obama in December 2009.<br /></div><br />In other words, they are only counting what is on the books.&nbsp; Also, they aren&#039;t counting the base pay for the additional soldiers needed, only the combat hazard pay.</div>

While it is most likely that the problems will not be remedied, it certainly is possible with persistent focus and time to get out of the debt problem we have. Canada went from ~64% GDP public debt in 1997 to ~28% public debt in 2008. I don&#039;t think we WILL course correct, but its definitely possible.<br /></div><br />We&#039;re at 80% of GDP and well over 100% if you look at gross debt. &nbsp;Plus, we aren&#039;t as responsible as Canadians.<br /></div><br />That&#039;s mostly thanks to Obama, increasing the debt from 10T to 16T in a matter of 4 years.<br /></div><br />Right... it couldn&#039;t have anything to do with Bush fucking up the economy and getting us involved with two wars. &nbsp;Sure, Obama&#039;s very far from perfect, but I doubt you could have done better given the same situation.<br /></div><br />The wars started in 2003, and they only had a tiny effect on deficit or debt, the defict and debt didn&#039;t increase so dramatically until 2009 when Obama took office. So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the wars.<br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/20614.png">http://i.imgur.com/20614.png</a><br /><br />Bush didn&#039;t fuck up the economy, the two biggest recessions in the past 20 years, were caused by dotcom bubble and the housing bubble, correct? Both are actually caused by Bill Clinton. The dotcom bubble is pretty evident, it happened entirely within Clinton&#039;s administration, and Clinton did nothing, he was the biggest cheerleader for the dotcom bubble. When the bubble went crashing down, he simply handed the recession to Bush. The housing bubble is a little more complicated, as housing cycles are very slow. But I think most people who investigated the cause, can agree that Clinton&#039;s huge expansion of the &quot;Community Re-investment Act&quot;, allowing Fannie and Freddie to blindly guarantee subprime mortgages, played a big part in forming that bubble. Bush actually asked for regulation of Fannie and Freddie, but the proposal got shot down by democrats in Congress.<br /></div><br />Nice graph, but the funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars weren&#039;t included in the budget, so they won&#039;t show up on that chart. &nbsp;Obama called BS and started counting it. &nbsp;That&#039;s why it looks so much worse after he took office. &nbsp;http://community.thenest.com/cs/ks/forums/thread/55667611.aspx<br /></div><br />Not true, the graph wouldn&#039;t be much different even if you add the war costs that were omitted from budget. Also the national debt can&#039;t lie, Bush increased the debt by 4.5T in 8 years, Obama increased the debt by 6T in 4 years, with wars that are supposedly has been winding down, I don&#039;t think it can be explained by war costs.</div>

Keeping people locked up in cages is just a waste of resources. Instead, we should use alternate forms of punishment. Fines, wage garnishments, etc. For henious crimes, just use a quick capital punishment and get it over with.</div>

While it is most likely that the problems will not be remedied, it certainly is possible with persistent focus and time to get out of the debt problem we have. Canada went from ~64% GDP public debt in 1997 to ~28% public debt in 2008. I don&#039;t think we WILL course correct, but its definitely possible.<br /></div><br />While the debt servicing is still lower than the tax revenue there is still a posibility of reducing the debt by cutting spending. Once the debt payments rise higher than the tax revenue the only way to eliminate the debt would be to raise taxes or print more money. To anybody who is familiar with math, it should be obvious that we only have a short time to fix things (balance the budget, pay down debt, etc.) before the situation gets completely out of control.<br /><br />What I would like to see happen: income tax should be flattened, exemptions and credits eliminated so there is a single tax rate for all income. At the same time, the spending should be drastically cut: Close oversea military bases, increase minimum social security receiving age, sell off national parks (preferably to states to make state parks or to non-profits who will care for them), <b>raise the interest rate on student loans</b>, give all federal employees a 10% paycut, and whatever else can be cut. After the tax revenue rises above the spending, the surplus can be used to pay down the debt, eliminating that huge chunk of the budget that goes to debt servicing. After the debt is eliminated, taxes should be lowered (still keeping it as a flat income tax so everybody benefits from the lowering) and governemnt services can be expanded.<br /></div><br />Fuck you. &nbsp;We&#039;re already paying 6% variable and the only likely direction is already up. &nbsp;Your talking about a group of people for which 50% can&#039;t find employment that actually uses the skills they were promised were valuable. &nbsp;Older people are working longer because of the tough economic times and so fresh graduates can&#039;t find jobs. &nbsp;How much more burden do you expect us to bear? &nbsp;Our &quot;elders&quot; have already given us a pile of steaming shit for a country when they were handed a land of opportunity. &nbsp;We won&#039;t take much more abuse before you start seeing violence. &nbsp;I personally am more anti-violence than almost anyone my age I know, but I can&#039;t control my peers.</div>

Many people take out student loans and then study subjects that will not help them pay back those loans. I even saw an article that says a &quot;computer science&quot; degree is basically worthless, companies are more interested in actual experience than a piece of paper.</div>

If everybody says &quot;Ok, the list is good except for the one point that effects me&quot;, then everything will get taken off the list and nothing will get done.<br /><br />Once we pay down the debt we can go back to subsidizing student loans (although perhaps not quite so much, we don&#039;t want to get back into debt as a country).<br /><br />If you cannot afford to pay back the student loans after you get out of college, perhaps you should reconsider taking them in the first place. (and by &quot;you&quot; I am not talking to you specifically, but the general you of all the people considering taking out student loans.) Many people take out student loans and then study subjects that will not help them pay back those loans. I even saw an article that says a &quot;computer science&quot; degree is basically worthless, companies are more interested in actual experience than a piece of paper.<br /></div><br />Every suggestion you gave other than &quot;cut federal employee pay by 10%&quot; affects me.<br /><br />As for the student loan issue, like I said, I am all for being drastically more restrictive on who can take them out.&nbsp; But that won&#039;t change the past where dumbasses thought it was a good idea to hand them out like candy and children were told that borrowing money to go to college was the only way to succeed.&nbsp; The reason they have to be subsidized just to get it down to 6% is because the default rate is high due to the ongoing structure of the program.&nbsp; But punishing me, who has paid as much or more than I owe every month since graduation is not fair.&nbsp; First, fix the problem by adding restrictions, then maybe we can work something out.&nbsp; By the way, when I decided to take them out, the rate was 4%.&nbsp; It&#039;s already up to 6% and slowly rising.&nbsp; As far as I can see, it is the only credit based industry in this country where interests rates are rising.&nbsp; They have gone down for everyone else.<br /><br />Oh, and while you&#039;re at it, let the housing market bottom instead of spending $40 billion/month subsidizing it.&nbsp; That&#039;s about $130 per person per month in case you haven&#039;t done the math.&nbsp; And yes, I&#039;m a homeowner, so that would hurt me too, but it&#039;s more fair than raising interest rates on student loans.&nbsp; Oh, and how about not bailing out corporations.&nbsp; We may have privatization of profits, but way too many losses are publicized.&nbsp; We left capitalism behind a long time ago.&nbsp; Hopefully one day we can make it back to it.</div>

Voters praised the former governor&#039;s ability to conceal his complete social disconnection and underlying hostility behind a wall of colloquial rhetoric and an approximation of warmth they described as &quot;much more realistic&quot; than Obama&#039;s.<br /><br />&quot;Last debate, Romney was a great sociopath,&quot; said Florida voter Jeff Yu, 28, who remarked that the Republican candidate&#039;s impressive ability to simulate the appearance of caring had improved markedly since the beginning of the campaign. &quot;He looked very comfortable and confident up there, even against a seasoned sociopath like Obama. He really helped me ignore the reality that to him, as to any politician, social interaction is nothing but a never-ending game of deception and psychological subterfuge, the only object of which is personal gain.&quot;<br /><br />Following Obama&#039;s noticeable hesitancy during the first debate, many of his supporters expressed worry that he was struggling to effect emotional normalcy with the same single-minded cunning and feigned humanity he exhibited in 2008. They agreed the pressure is now on the president to show that he has not forgotten how to callously manipulate the American public into thinking he is anything at all like them.<br /><br />&quot;I want to see that same beguiling sociopath who, four years ago, conned me into believing his psyche was somehow differently wired from every other charming, sociopathic politician who had ever lived,&quot; said Obama supporter Phoebe Greenwald, 43. &quot;What happened to all his seemingly earnest, though of course meticulously contrived, rhetoric about hope and change that made us all like him and think he was in some way psychologically healthy and well-adjusted, which of course no human being in the history of modern politics ever has been?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Obama just needs to do what [sociopathic Vice President] Joe Biden did last week,&quot; Greenwald added. &quot;I mean, he masterfully out-sociopathed Paul Ryan, which is no easy task, believe me.&quot;<br /><br />No matter the outcome of tonight&#039;s debate, sources agreed that the most talented sociopath will likely be elected in November and, depending on what kind of support he might receive from like-minded sociopaths in Congress, will then spend the next four years satisfying his malformed brain&#039;s ceaseless thirst for power and glory.<br /></div></div></div>

The US dollar still has a lingering good perception, which props up the exchange rate over and above what would be expected from &#039;rational&#039; market forces. A similar thing happens in parts of Europe where people travel across borders to work. That work may be minimum wage where they&#039;re temporarily staying, but they typically save or send money back to their family where, thanks to the exchange rate, those dollars or euros buy a lot more.<br /><br />Many US people don&#039;t seem to understand (or somehow refuse to accept) that this is part of the reason why they have had such an easy life for so many decades. With endless wars and coups propping up the petro-dollar, together with &quot;the American Dream&quot; helping create a virtuous circle of irrational currency strength, if this situation collapses, people will have to completely re-evaluate what they thought was a fair amount of work for putting food on the table.<br /></div>A fair amount of work for putting food on the table?&nbsp; You mean something other than a 40+ hour workweek?&nbsp; I certainly hope we don&#039;t come to the point where we have to work, on average, a longer week than 40 hours just to put food on the table</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I may very well end up voting for Romney. As a hardcore anarcho-capitalist, that&#039;s hard to admit. Mainly, I see opportunity to make money off the public perception of the economy in a Romney term. Secondly, I like some of Romney&#039;s rhetoric. He is at least talking about some capitalist ideals, and decentralization of government.<br /><br />That being said, they&#039;re both puppets. It&#039;s far too late to recover. Hyperinflation is the only way out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Voting at all is wasted votes, since the only difference between the 2 candidates that will actually be on the ballot is that one is black and one is white.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The funny/sad thing is pretty much <i>every</i> other voting system is superior to plurality. I&#039;m a big fan of the Schulze method, but since most people find it confusing I jump on the IRV bandwagon. IRV can fail too (they all can) but not as much as plurality has already failed. Score voting would be a great improvement too.<br /><br />Part of the reason I&#039;m leaning towards Jill Stein is her clear support of IRV, even though I agree with Gary Johnson on most other issues. IMHO the third party supporters need to stick together long enough to say &quot;we need a better way&quot;.</div>

Freeze all Spending at current level. <br />#2. Remove Capital Gains tax. <br />#3. Remove Income Tax &amp; associated employment related taxes. <br />#4. Install Flat (sales) Tax at 20%. Convert IRS into regulating entity for monitoring, collecting and reporting on income from this new tax.<br />#5. Open Borders. Remove tarifs. <br />#6. Wait a month. <br />#7. Look at the new report from the converted IRS - do the math on deficit new tax income. <br />#8. Reduce all government spending by the percentage needed to balance the budget + double the cost of interest on the national debt. <br />#9. Repeat 6-9 until nation is out of debt. <br /><br />Simple easy and effective. It would take all the downward pressure off the economy. We&#039;d have an initial 30-50% reduction in government spending and the total on collected taxes would rise to make up the lost income in under 2 years... aided by all the former illegals now paying sales taxes and the massive growth the economy would under go by making it much cheaper to employ someone. <br />And as soon as that happened then we can start growing entitlement programs and spending in all areas to consume the surplus. Being happy with a 10 or 20 or 50 year plan to pay off the debt. <br /></div>

Default on the debt ( There&#039;s no way it&#039;s going to be paid back so don&#039;t even bother trying because that will just lengthen the depression ) <br /><br />2. Make it illegal for any government employee to borrow in the taxpayers name, no more borrowing at the expense of others or to get re-elected<br /><br />3. introduce laws removing any restrictions on competing currencies <br /><br />4. Make one self-defense law stating &quot;If you are attacked then you have a right to defend yourself as long as you do not kill the attacker or attackers&quot; <br /><br />5. 5% flat tax rate to take care of the genuinely helpless who can&#039;t fend for themselves<br /><br />6. Arrest all known board members of the Federal Reserve and shut the place down<br /><br />7. Almost forgot, legalise prostitution and all drugs, for prostitution though I would make it so that pimping wouldn&#039;t be allowed to prevent the women in that situation being abused<br /><br />As for Romney and Obama, they are both the same to me, nothing more than Imperialists wearing different symbols, they both want to expand the empire and they both support the military industrial complex.</div>

Freeze all Spending at current level. <br />#2. Remove Capital Gains tax. <br />#3. Remove Income Tax &amp; associated employment related taxes. <br />#4. Install Flat (sales) Tax at 20%. Convert IRS into regulating entity for monitoring, collecting and reporting on income from this new tax.<br />#5. Open Borders. Remove tarifs. <br />#6. Wait a month. <br />#7. Look at the new report from the converted IRS - do the math on deficit new tax income. <br />#8. Reduce all government spending by the percentage needed to balance the budget + double the cost of interest on the national debt. <br />#9. Repeat 6-9 until nation is out of debt. <br /><br />Simple easy and effective. It would take all the downward pressure off the economy. We&#039;d have an initial 30-50% reduction in government spending and the total on collected taxes would rise to make up the lost income in under 2 years... aided by all the former illegals now paying sales taxes and the massive growth the economy would under go by making it much cheaper to employ someone. <br />And as soon as that happened then we can start growing entitlement programs and spending in all areas to consume the surplus. Being happy with a 10 or 20 or 50 year plan to pay off the debt. <br /><br /></div><br />Great, whats the name of your cult that will follow and vow to implement and strive for this?</div>

For that matter, so are Ron Paul, and Andre Barnett. (Johnson supports equal employment for women, but I don&#039;t see a voting record for affirmative action. I assume he&#039;d be similar in stance to Dr. Paul.) Know who and what you&#039;re voting for (http://www.ontheissues.org/Civil_Rights.htm).<br /><br />Romney and Obama are provably identical on many issues. That&#039;s why Political compass places them so close. Your saying &quot;I&#039;m sure they are completely different&quot; just shows how completely <i>unsure</i> you are about it.</div>

It seems to me that whenever president talks about religion ppl like him. Shouldn&#039;t be the government controlled by logical assumptions? <br />Also so many people want a president who could create jobs. Well. I believe there will be a point where all labor jobs will be completely eliminated. This is why I believe education should be important and those people who worked in labor could study something else and get a higher level job. Interesting point not everyone wants to do that. I worked in retail for minimum wage (still do not as much though) while going to school because obviously I couldn&#039;t get anything better. I&#039;ve met so many people who doesn&#039;t want education and they just want to work where they don&#039;t have to think. O_o <br />It seems that with progression of our technology we are just moving closer to that line. One day we could possibly create ai as ours, I could see ai controlling the government (people) because everything they do will be based on logic and it&#039;s results. </div>
