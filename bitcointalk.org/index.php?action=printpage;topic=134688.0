					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually in playing around with the &quot;raw tx&#039;s&quot; API and then using &quot;importprivkey&quot; for an &quot;offline&quot; generated address I experienced a similar problem (didn&#039;t see the address in the &quot;receive&quot; list but did see the unspent output in the &quot;listunspent&quot; list).<br /><br />I resolved my problem by sending another tx from the unspent output to another address that *was* in my &quot;receive&quot; list but still don&#039;t quite understand why the problem happened.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There&#039;s definitely something quirky.&nbsp; I tried previously in the GUI and had to restart it sometimes to get the newly imported addresses to appear.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is a semi-old thread, but I wanted to report to you all what happened to me.<br /><br />I imported a private key, and as stated in the OP, it showed up in my &quot;Address Book&quot;, not my &quot;Receive Coins&quot; list. Well, what I did was shut down the Bitcoin-QT client and re-opened it. When I re-opened it, it told me the wallet was out of sync, and after it finished getting IN sync (hahaha) it showed up in my &quot;Receive Coins&quot; list like I expected it to from the get-go.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tested sending money to it and sending money out of it, but I&#039;ll do that later on when I have enough coins to lost in case something goes wrong.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve haven&#039;t used that function previous to 0.7.1, so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s new. Same thing happened to me. Just had to restart bitcoin-qt before it showed up in the right spot. I figure that it adds it to the wallet.dat file, but doesn&#039;t re-import it to the program. Or something. It&#039;s on my growing list of user unfriendly features of Bitcoin-qt.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If a new private key is added it ends up in the address book first. Well, we see only its address.<br /><br />When the next new block is received and processed that new address is scanned against the new block (transaction list) and the address moves to &quot;receive coins&quot;. <br /><br />Still a rescan is needed if that address has old coins sitting around as without a rescan you will never see them.<br /><br /><br /></div>
