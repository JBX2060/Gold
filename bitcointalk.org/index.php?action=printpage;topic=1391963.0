					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So far at this moment,its still working and I find no problem. I&#039;d claimed already twice. I think only the bonuses were affected as I find the loyalty bonus is zero.Hope this is already fixed. Good Luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I never had similar problems on Moonbit. I recommend to claim with your bitcoin address, not with email. For example you can use Xapo wallet address and receive weekly payment. In this way, you don&#039;t get similar problems as stated in this topic.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This message is displayed for over 24 hours. And only on the account associated with xapo is not important at the bitcoin address or email.<br /><br />Accounts blockchain or electrum wallet is working. From my referrals I recommend to use xapo as the fastest and most without a fee.<br /><br />Now those who have xapo account will lose the loyalty bonus.<br /><br />The admin of the site obviously do not care about the reputation but ! it undermines my front of my referrals&nbsp; &gt;:(</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi, sorry for the late update. i finally decided to close moon bitcoin and only reopened it after another 24 hours (48 hours in total) and it started working fine...but loyalty points =0. As for using non xapo wallets i wouldn&#039;t know as i have been using Xapo from day 1 with this faucet. In view of this irregular but frequent disruption i would strongly advise everyone to a Xapo wallet and clear their satoshis at least twice a day into their xapo wallet. Better safe than sorry. &nbsp;;). Cheers </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmmm...I seem to be having that problem today, didn&#039;t have a big loyalty bonus though. I wonder how long it can take to be fixed. By the way, since I am pretty new to cryptos, does anyone know if it is possible to get rich by referring to many many ppl? I&#039;m talking like 10k ppl. :D </div>
