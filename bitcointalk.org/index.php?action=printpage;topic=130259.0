					Post by: <b>Scopedude</b> on <b>December 11, 2012, 06:31:34 PM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Last night I accidentally grabbed a sent to address instead of my address from my bitcoin wallet and I sent 20BTC to this address from my bitcoin-exchange account.<br /><br />1QEyVFiPAaSqtCgjaEmATJKeXjFr1oSBuj<br /><br />The bitcoins are just sitting there. &nbsp;I had sent 10.17 BTC to this address back on 5/28/2012 but I have no idea what this address is.<br /><br />Can anyone help me find out where I sent these coins?<br /><br />2 BTC bounty to anyone that can help me recover these coins.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">First of all, be careful, always double check the address before sending. It&#039;s saved me a few times. But gentle scolding asides, I&#039;m doing some digging on the coins&#039; final resting place. I will update this with more info eventually. A heads up, you are highly unlikely to find any way to get these coins back, but I&#039;ll give it the old college try nonetheless.<br /><br />The coins are proving difficult to track from your last transaction. They get bundled in with a bunch of other inputs until you&#039;re dealing with hundreds of coins at once. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If it helps you remember at all, the original transaction was for about $52.17 USD at the time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I hate to admit it, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;re gonna get them back. Unless some random person happens to stumble here that happens to own the address with your 20 coins in it, they&#039;re probably gone for good. The news doesn&#039;t get any better if the address was swept. Typically private keys are deleted after a sweep, since there&#039;s not much point to keeping a zero balance address. Sorry bud. I&#039;ll see if I can find any news that&#039;ll change this, but I hate to say, don&#039;t get your hopes up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Based on this transaction:<br />http://blockchain.info/tx/6aac96271f6b9b882580e2b80184482d47b87ad69c779b909b5180effd5fae8f<br /><br />It seems like 1QEyVFiPAaSqtCgjaEmATJKeXjFr1oSBuj and 1NpwQtw1AbhzcE7PRhhEDEyaZFoQJSgncH are owned by the same entity (since inputs associated with both addresses were used in the same transaction).<br /><br /><br />Based on this transaction:<br />http://blockchain.info/tx/cc2c503870e8b02321b4c33bc739880d14bd744d44fa1fd52f875dca9123c0be<br /><br />It seems like the entity that owns 1NpwQtw1AbhzcE7PRhhEDEyaZFoQJSgncH sent 10,000 coins to 1DkyBEKt5S2GDtv7aQw6rQepAvnsRyHoYM on 2012-04-17.<br /><br /><br />And based on this conversation:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=94675.0<br /><br />There seems to be some belief that 1DkyBEKt5S2GDtv7aQw6rQepAvnsRyHoYM is an address owned by Pirate40.<br /><br /><br />Is there any chance you &quot;invested&quot; with a &quot;Pirate Pass Through&quot; in the past? &nbsp;Could 1QEyVFiPAaSqtCgjaEmATJKeXjFr1oSBuj be the address of that &quot;Pirate Pass through&quot;?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So you can&#039;t receive to the same address you sent from? That makes it even more tricky to get it back. Hopefully it finds it way back to your wallet.</div>

You know what might be good to do? Send a small transaction to there with a public note attached to the blockchain, with an address to send it back to. If you want to PM me an address you can receive at, I&#039;ll send it for you. You can verify that it&#039;s done in the blockchain.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The 1QEyVFiPAaSqtCgjaEmATJKeXjFr1oSBuj address also seems to be owned by the same entity that owns 1DuneTsrCnapAKWpZCttRnLTH59PMD1pzf<br /><br />That looks a bit like a vanity address, doesn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Maybe someone who knows who owns 1DuneTsrCnapAKWpZCttRnLTH59PMD1pzf will stumble into this thread and be able to help you?</div>
