					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">but downloading the block chain isn&#039;t what makes it slow, it is the verification which is hindered by your CPU and IO js adding more nodes wouldn&#039;t make a difference.</div>

Initially it&#039;s just 8, but after few hours you should be have much more connections.<br /></div><br />it has been 6 hours till now and only 8 connection<br /><br />is there a way to get more connection&#039;s</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You might be firewalled. 8 is all I have ever been able to get without tweaking. I find 8 to be enough. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have the impression that, if your node is not listening to incoming connections, bitcoind will not attempt to establish more than 8.<br />Can some one confirm that?<br /><br />OP, if you <i>want</i> to listen to income connections, maybe you should check if port 8333 is open in your firewall. In case you have a router/NAT, redirect its 8333 to your computer&#039;s 8333.<br />If you don&#039;t know what the hell I&#039;m talking about, just ignore this and be happy with 8 connections, it&#039;s enough, and it&#039;s not the reason for the slow blockchain download as others have pointed. It&#039;s IO more than anything.</div>

The Bitcoin.org client will made eight outgoing connections.&nbsp; So either the client isn&#039;t configured for UPnP or the network doesn&#039;t support it or the network (or local system&#039;s software firewall) is restricting port 8333 traffic from reaching the client.</div>
