					Title: <b>[SOLVED] Bitcoind RPC client freezes on &quot;move&quot; command. </b><br />
					Post by: <b>SlickTheNick</b> on <b>December 13, 2012, 05:16:05 AM</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys, so I installed the bitcoind server on my VPS (latest version of ubuntu, 64 bit). For the most part it works fine, however when I try and use the &#039;move&#039; command to move balances between accounts, it just hangs there and the server freezes and doesnt accept any more commands (besides the help command). Iv tried searching around a bunch, but I cant seem to find a solution, and most of the information I have found is for windows users..<br /><br />Is this a common problem? any ideas for a easy way to solve this? Am I going to have to compile a custom build of bitcoin and reinstall it? If so, could anyone tell me how I would go about doing that (total noob to compiling things), or point me to a resource that would show me how?<br /><br /><br />now for part 2..<br /><br />Im trying to use the jsonRPCClient for PHP to build a web app that uses bitcoin. Part of it requires moving balances between accounts.. hence the issue above. But also, whenever I try and use the sendaddress() call, all I get is a fatal error that states that the http request to the bitcoin server was refused.. <br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">Fatal error: Uncaught exception &#039;Exception&#039; with message &#039;Unable to connect to .... in jsonRPCClient.php</div><br />I tried the command directly from the command line, and recieved an error saying that due to the small size of the transaction it required a transaction fee (i forgot to change it from 0.000 btc).<br /><br />Anyways, is it normal behavior for it to throw up the fatal error like that if a command returns false? Shouldnt it just return that the command failed, or return the error that bitcoin spits out, instead of just killing PHP? It doesnt seem to be very well documented..<br /><br />thanks in advance<br /><br /><br />*edit* see my post on page 2 about how I solved this</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not sure about the part one. For the second part, you should implement exception handling. You should have something like the following:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">try {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sendaddress();<br />} catch(Exception $e) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo &quot;There was an issue sending the bitcoins. Please try again or notify the site&#039;s administrator if you continue to receive this message.&quot;;<br />}</div><br />That will allow php to continue to execute the rest of the code. You should use a try...catch block whenever there is the possibility of an exception being raised.</div>

Pretty sure this will work..<br /><br />maybe I just have no idea what im doing, but I cant seem to get the server to work. According to the release candidate post, all I have to do is copy over the &#039;bitcoind&#039; file. So i went to /usr/bin/bitcoin, copied the file over, gave the new file executable permissions (sudo chmod +x bitcoind)<br /><br />now, when, heres what I get:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"># sudo bitcoind<br />exec: 14: /usr/lib/bitcoin/bitcoind: not found<br /></div><br />the file <i>is</i> there though, not sure what im missing here?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m no expert, but my guess is that it can&#039;t find a library it&#039;s expecting or something. That is, something trying to load the program is getting a &quot;file not found&quot;, and somehow that&#039;s bubbling up to a confusing error message.</div>
