					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I read everywhere when receiving coins, wait for at least 6 blocks, whats this about? Is it possible to send fake coins, have them show up in my wallet, and go away later?<br /><br />Normally I get the coins within 60 seconds, can they be reversed?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Understand that the confirmations are required in order to prevent a &quot;double-spend&quot;.<br /><br />So although you can never receive a &quot;fake&quot; bitcoin (either the tx output is valid or not) it is possible (although not highly probable) that you could be sent a tx that later becomes &quot;invalid&quot; due to another tx using the same input having been sent at roughly the same time.<br /><br />Certainly for high value txs I would recommend waiting for at least 6 confirmations.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t believe that this is correct in the case of a successful &gt;50% attack.<br /><br />AFAIA if someone has enough hashing resources that they can mine blocks much faster than the rest of the network combined then if they simply keep mining new blocks (even with no tx&#039;s if they like) without publishing them they can let the blockchain grow as many blocks as they like and then suddenly announce a longer chain (this attack can only go back as far as a &quot;checkpoint&quot; AFAIA).<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In order to pull off a successful %51 attack, you&#039;d need to have an array of computers that could exceed 24.07 TeraHashes<sup>[1] (http://bitcoinwatch.com/)</sup>. That&#039;s the mining power of ~480 of the most powerful, announced, but as of yet <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unreleased</span> ASICs. When ASICs do come out, this will skyrocket, and will require a lot more processing power. For those of you that want this in FLOPS (Floating Point Operations per second), that&#039;s 305.63 PetaFLOPS per Second<sup>[1] (http://bitcoinwatch.com/)</sup>. The most powerful supercomputer in the world is only capable of 17.59 petaflops<sup>[2] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS#Records)</sup>. Which means you&#039;d need more than 17 of these supercomputers in order to pull off a %51 attack, (assuming they&#039;re optimized for Bitcoin Mining, which they&#039;re not.) You&#039;d also need over 54.5 times the amount of processing power of the Folding@home distributed computing network (5.6 Petaflops<sup>[3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS#Distributed_computing_records)</sup>) That&#039;s a shit ton of computing power. All to double spend. It&#039;s just not feasible :P </div>
