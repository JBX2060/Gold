					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Been using their service for the past month and so far everything works the way it supposed to. Are you sure, the transaction has received confirmations (due to the amount of stuck transactions as of late)? Can you post the TX&#039;s here?<br />On my personal experience, my wallet is credited by 10 minutes delay (after receiving enough confirmations). When you go to &quot;My Kardiz Wallet&quot; &gt; View pending &amp; past deposits &gt; what&#039;s the status there?<br /><hr />I&#039;ve noticed an increase in complaints, ever since they&#039;ve changed their name to kardiz.<br />Their thread here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1624128.0<br /><br /><b>Update:</b><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1919955.msg19046642#msg19046642">Quote from: hugo4 on May 16, 2017, 11:33:56 AM</a></div><div class="quote">It says in View pending &amp; past deposits:<br /><br />2017-05-15 22:25:22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitcoin Deposit<br />$59.47 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending blockchain confirmations (0/3) <br /><br />I got an email yesterday that it will be put in my wallet in 3 hours<br />still nothing...<br /></div>Thank you for clarifying it.

I&#039;ve read and encountered problems like this which most people are complaining specially those technical errors likely to happen among them. I was also been thinking scam accusation last 2 months passed that of a sportsbetting site, the btc amount I sent wasn&#039;t been credited to registered acount of their site; gladly amount sent was only few values if btc. If this continued to happen to you, please post a scam accusations in the betting site thread and in public forum so that it will be stopped having victims again.</div>

It clearly states right in your own post that it doesn&#039;t have the confirmations. Due to the backlog, this could be fast or it could be a week or longer. This is all based on you not using enough fees (or whoever sent it to them not using enough).</div>

If this issue was solve via giftcode i think they are still active they are just halving problem when peopel are depositing maybe i think the problem in coinizy is abusing their service because there is a group in skype almost 500 plus people there are always using vcc just to do fraud of using bing and adwords about advertising..&nbsp; or abusing trial using their vcc in other site like seo services. <br />Since you update the site that they give a giftcode well i think they are still fixing the issue about it.. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No it isn&#039;t maybe you have sent with less fees or you clicked too many times to check on blockchain. It&#039;s better if you send them a support ticket , as sometimes for deposit issues they don&#039;t reply but process it for you. And ya there confirmation takes time. Next please send a support ticket wait for 48 hours if you get no reply then only post any sort of accusations.</div>
