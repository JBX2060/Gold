It&#039;s just a bit difficult for them to build reputation as most people don&#039;t want to publicly admit they bought from there. Maybe private recommendations will do. Or people can say &quot;I know somebody who successfully bought from them&quot;.

			Anybody investigate the idea of reputation and middlemen/mules?<br /><br />I could see a Tor hosted site (or a distributed trust ring, like bitcoin itself) that essentially links a bitcoin address, a PGP key, and a list of transactions completed/failed...<br /><br />You route your goods - whatever they are (how about firearms - since it seems like some of you are so freaked out about drugs - HAH) through a chain of trusted mules.<br /><br />The transfers start small, maybe shipping test packages with micropayments for each step in the route.<br /><br />Like onion routing for the real world - exit nodes can go last mile from the postal service to a GPS dead drop.<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested in forking this topic to get away from drugs, guns, etc - whatever the contraband is.&nbsp; The point is there is a &quot;cost&quot; with flaunting the law, and with something assuring anonymity (if done right) there is a way to arbitrage between the legal and extralegal networks.<br />
