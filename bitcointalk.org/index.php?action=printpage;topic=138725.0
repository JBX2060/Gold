					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I sent a payment 1 hour and 13 minutes ago to somebody. No confirmations so my purchase hasn&#039;t gone through. I received a payment earlier at 4:26PM eastern standard time and it&#039;s now 9:20PM and there are only 25 confirmations on it. Is something wrong with the network...? surely these numbers can&#039;t be normal.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s probably why.&nbsp; It will go through eventually but will take considerably longer.&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looking at block chain.info, it appears that sometimes there is a gap of an hour or more between blocks being generated. I don&#039;t understand why this happens, but I think that would delay all transactions and create a big backlog, because the blocks are what confirm the transactions.&nbsp; Paying a bigger fee might get you to the head of the line, but it looks like a flaw in the system.<br /><br />On 1/24, I had a transfer between codebase and Mt. Gox that took over 6 hours! This does not build trust in bitcoin as a currency.&nbsp; Will this get worse as transaction volume grows?</div>
