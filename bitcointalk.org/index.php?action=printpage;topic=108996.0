					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all. <br /><br />I just checked my Satoshi client for the first time in weeks today (it&#039;s always running in the background) and I saw that the last downloaded block was received 17 days ago, as well as the warning message: Displayed transactions may not be correct! You may need to upgrade or other nodes may need to upgrade.<br /><br />Problem is, I&#039;m already running 0.6.3 in Windows, so I have nothing to upgrade to... or is this a different meaning of the word upgrade?<br /><br />What&#039;s going on?</div>
