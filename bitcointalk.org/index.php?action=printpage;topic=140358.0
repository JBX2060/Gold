					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m getting the same problem.&nbsp; Am using the blockchain Iphone app. I have scanned the QR code and get the &quot;Getting Unspent Outputs&quot; message which is still there 10 minutes later whilst the seller invoice just expires. I really WANT to pay with BTC but at this rate it will just have to be debit card ;-(</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Success eventually. About 7 minutes from initiating the send until the send went through (third try). 15 minutes in all.<br />Anyway, I have now done my little bit for the health of the greater bitcoin economy ;-) <br /><br /><br /></div>
