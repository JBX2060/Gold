					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In three situations:<br /><br />1) If the coins are sent from a local wallet<br />2) If the coins are sent from an online wallet with a static address<br />3) If the coins are sent from an online wallet with a dynamic address<br /><br />I&#039;ve always been afraid of mis-copying/mis-pasting an address into the corresponding field, so I want to get this cleared to prevent future worry.<br /><br />Would appreciate any info :]<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There is a checksum to prevent sending to a completely bogus address.<br /><br />However, if you send to the <i>wrong</i> address, you lose your money.&nbsp; If you send to the wrong address and you happen to know who it is, you can ask them to give your money back, but it&#039;s on their honor to actually do so.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">the 3 situations are exactly the same.<br /><br />If you send coins to an INCORRECT but VALID address they are gone forever.<br /><br />Bitcoin addresses have a 32 bit checksum so the odds of creating a typo which is INCORRECT but VALID is about one in 4 billion.<br />Still it could happen.&nbsp; If you are copying and pasting the odds are essentially zero (that you could drop or add an extra digit and still produce a valid address with the same checksum).<br /><br />The much more common problem is doing something stupid:<br />For example thinking you are sending coins to yourself (i.e. your address) but copying the last outgoing address and sending a boatload of coins to someone you sent coins to before.<br />Obviously the network can&#039;t protect you from that.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ah, thank you two for the help! I was always under the impression that if coins were sent to a completely non-existent address, it would still leave the wallet, but later return to the sender&#039;s address.<br /><br /></div>

There might be a corresponding private key on someone&#039;s computer, or there might not, but the network doesn&#039;t know that. For example, I have my Bitcoin savings in an address that doesn&#039;t have its private key stored anywhere but my brain. There&#039;s no way for the network to say, &quot;Whoops, nobody is using this address--return to sender!&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What I mean by non-existent address is a 34-character address that has never been generated or used before.<br /><br />For example, my address:<br /><br />1F2ZoMkKXpjxe4SbhmU8LvXHkmCdANdsDS<br /><br />But mistakenly modified as<br /><br />1F2ZoMkKXpjxe4SbhmU8LvXHkmCdANdsD<b>A</b><br /><br />But as long as that checksum is in place, I feel safe.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How would the network know an address hasn&#039;t been generated before?<br /><br />I take my offline computer, generate a keypair and print it out on a piece of paper. &nbsp;How would the network &quot;know&quot; that address has been generated.<br /><br />As far as &quot;not been used before&quot; that wouldn&#039;t be very useful check.&nbsp; A new address by default hasn&#039;t been used before so you could never send coins to a new address.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most that have been said is true...<br /><br />DeathAndTaxes let me help you :)<br /><br />Whenever you install a new bitcoind or generate a new wallet.dat you are generating out of random numbers a &quot;secret key&quot;. With this &quot;secret key&quot; and more random numbers you can generate several &quot;public keys&quot;, know as &quot;addresses&quot;. With your secret key, you can &quot;claim&quot; your public keys as a proof those are yours.<br /><br />This can happen complete offline, so the network doesnt know your &quot;addresses&quot; nor your &quot;secret key&quot;. The second you solve a block and generate 50 BTC or you receive a transaction, your address will appear in the &quot;chain&quot; and therfor is public visible. As a result you can send BTC to &quot;valid&quot; addresses, but those addresses dont necessary need to exist. So it could happen, that you install a new bitcoind, generate an address and instantly have funds in your wallet, because someone else send some BTC to that address before it was actually existing.<br /><br />An address is &quot;valid&quot; when its hash has a special value. So like already said, its nearly impossible that you can misstype an address and its still &quot;valid&quot;.<br /><br />Just to make it clear, &quot;valid&quot; and &quot;existing&quot; are not the same. Addresses can be valid and not exist (not yet generated) at the same time!</div>

That is, if I generated an address, and never said anything to the network, how could the network know that sending to that address is &quot;more correct&quot; than sending to an unowned but valid address?<br /><br />The answer is &quot;it can&#039;t&quot;.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Can I attempt to &quot;dumb this down?&quot;<br /><br />I think the OP was asking, what if, offline I create a wallet address with 1BbwCCkwWDVJXLojxYpZrtPp8LSSRghisH by just typing it out... better yet, my five year old just bangs on the keys of the computer and she created my new address.&nbsp; Now I physically hand someone a piece of paper with 1BbwCCkwWDVJXLojxYpZrtPp8LSSRghisH written on it for a fellow bitcoin&#039;er and they send money to that aforementioned address.<br /><br />For the first time ever, I bring my wallet online and find out that this mysterious wallet address belonged to Jane SMith for the past year, but never knew.&nbsp; <br /><br />Did Jain Smith just receive that money?&nbsp; Is my wallet &quot;Invalid&quot; but &quot;Online with the P2P network?&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well the OP wasn&#039;t asking that. &nbsp;Your scenario is different in a couple of ways and I also think you are confusing some key terms.<br /><br />1) While you could produce an address randomly it would be useless. &nbsp;The address is the hash of the public key which is derived from the private key. &nbsp; The private key (secret) for the address give you control over funds sent to that address. Generating a random address without a private key simply produces an address where coins are lost forever.<br /><br />2) Addresses have a 32 bit checksum. &nbsp;4,294,967,295 out of 4,294,967,296 random addresses will just result in an invalid address. &nbsp;Your client decodes and checks the address and if it is invalid it will not create the transaction.<br /><br />3) If you did happen to beat the odds (1 in 4,294,967,296) and randomly generate a valid address then whoever has the private keys controls the funds. &nbsp;Given how many possible addresses there are, the probability that you would randomly type an address someone (anyone) has the key for is essentially 0%. &nbsp; If you did that person would have access to any funds sent to their address. Otherwise any funds sent to it will be lost forever.<br /><br />3) &nbsp;Address =/= Wallet. &nbsp;A wallet is a client side &quot;concept&quot;. &nbsp;It is a collection of private keys (and other tx data). &nbsp;The network doesn&#039;t &quot;know&quot; about wallets, just addresses. &nbsp;The input for every txn is the output of a prior txn.&nbsp; If nobody has the corresponding private key then nobody can spend the coins.<br /><br /><br /></div>
