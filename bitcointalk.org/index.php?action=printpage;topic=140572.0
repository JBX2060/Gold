Point some miners at it, and see it work. You said you see a lot of code for back end. Yes, that&#039;s right. Are there any stratum open source projects? That&#039;s where you need to go with ASIC&#039;s appearing in the wild now. <br /><br />There is no good front end and no open source secure one. You&#039;ll need to do the front on by yourself. That&#039;s what all the big players have done and most of their back ends are proprietary as well. If you can&#039;t build bitcoin from source and don&#039;t even know where to start, you should probably move on right now.<br /><br />The only way you could probably really attract a crowd is offering PPS and you&#039;ll need plenty of coin to front until you can build some hash behind you and start getting some blocks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think they&#039;re right unfortunately, Bitcoin is going to start being used more like a currency now, the difficulty is just going to get too high for most people to make any profit from it, so I suggest you go and do stuff for Bitcoins instead, thankfully that can actually be done because of it being decentralised etc. unlike paper money :P</div>

And of course I don&#039;t sound technical when i am answering dumb questions from dumb people. LOL your going to lose all your coins trying to setup something that is a failure.<br /></div>I never said that i do not want/need Backend of a project (I need the back to make the Front) To call me dumb is a big understatement just like you are sow please leave this thread alone&nbsp; <br /><br />And thanks guys for pointing it out...i have contacted a good coder with enough experience to see what he thinks about it..<br /><br />If it cost to much what you all are saying then i&#039;m thinking of building a new marketplace where u can pay with BTC cost is less and only one i know is SR..<br /><br />Thanks for the support<br /><br />And i will let you know whatever comes out when i get my message back<br /><br />Cheers<br /></div>
