					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><span style="font-size: 16pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">Ethbay aims to become the the eBay of Ethereum with an Ethereum based decentralized peer to peer marketplace. With Ethbay, users can buy and sell anything using Ethereum as opposed to the regular fiat currencies accepted on standard marketplaces. It is one of the first truly anonymous marketplaces in existence. Users are not required to provide any personal information when signing up. Transactions are protected under an ultra secure Ethereum smart contract escrow to keep both the buyer and the seller safe. Ethbay also offers its service at a significantly reduced fee over other competitors. A low 1% fee is charged on the funds a seller receives when they make a sale as opposed to many popular marketplaces such as eBay and amazon who charge 10-15% fees to the seller. Ethbay also eliminates listing fees that many competitors charge. Fees are only charged when an item sells. A dispute resolution system will also be in place to quickly and easily resolve any disputes that may arise between buyers and sellers. <br /><br />Ethbay is an Ethereum based ERC20 token. Investors will receive 5,000 Ethbay (EBAY) tokens for every 1 ETH they contribute, with up to a 25% bonus offered for early investors. There are a total of 100 million tokens in existence with up to 80 million tokens available for sale during the ICO. Token holders receive a proportional share of the profits generated by the platform paid to them in Ethereum on a monthly basis. Token holders will also have voting rights on site proposals and can submit their own proposals if they hold at least 200,000 EBAY tokens.<br /><br />The ICO will begin on June 7 and will conclude on August 7. For more information, please visit our website at www.ethbay.co</span></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2987798.msg35425404#msg35425404">Quote from: Neurocrypt on April 23, 2018, 09:53:56 PM</a></div><div class="quote">This looks good however there are thousands of crypto payment please how is Ethbay different?<br /></div><br /><span style="font-size: 16pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"> Of course! We understand the large amount of competition currently in the cryptocurrency space.<br /><br />One major feature our platform offers is complete anonymity with no personal information required to register on or to use the site. Since other marketplaces require at least some personal information to be able to register. Even if it&#039;s just an email address. This also includes an encrypted messaging system to be able to communicate with other users with complete privacy. <br /><br />Many other marketplaces such as Bitbay also require the usage of the platform&#039;s own cryptocurrency to be able to make purchases on the site. While we do plan to implement the acceptance of Ethbay tokens for purchases on our platform, we also want to provide a space that makes cryptocurrency in general a more usable form of money. Since a common complaint is that cryptocurrency can&#039;t be used to buy much since most places don&#039;t accept it. Obviously, some other marketplaces do accept other cryptocurrency which I will cover in this next point:<br /><br />Other marketplaces generally only accept bitcoin or in rare cases a couple other cryptocurrencies. While Ethbay is an Ethereum marketplace, we will have a built in exchange service to accept almost any cryptocurrency when making purchases that will quickly and easily be exchanged for Ethereum when transferring the funds to the seller. We currently estimate that about 80% of all cryptocurrencies will qualify for the exchange service. The other 20% are cryptocurrencies with especially low trading volumes that would be difficult to quickly exchange so these would not qualify for this service. There will be a small fee charged to use this exchange service that will be shared with token holders in addition to the 1% transaction fees.<br /><br />In addition, other marketplaces generally only focus on the ability to buy and sell goods. Ethbay also wants to offer the ability to buy and sell services (like a decentralized fiverr) with a platform feature called Ethbay Services. As well the ability to transact locally using Ethereum as a base currency with another platform feature called Ethbay Classifieds. Just like with the buying and selling of goods, this service will significantly reduce fees normally charged when buying and selling services since fiverr charges a 5% fee to the buyer and a whopping 20% fee to the seller. Our built in cryptocurrency exchange can also be used to make purchases on both of these other platform features although Ethereum will remain as the base currency.<br /><br />For people who wish to use the platform but don&#039;t own any cryptocurrency due to the high barriers of entry currently present to enter the cryptocurrency space, we have that covered as well. We plan to offer an easy to use fiat exchange to quickly buy Ethereum with fiat to use on the platform. We are experimenting with ways to offer this service in a secure manner without requiring any identity documents to use it (again the anonymity feature). Again, a small fee will be charged to use this service that will be shared with token holders.<br /><br />This is not intended as an exhaustive list of differences between Ethbay and other competitors but just highlights a few major differences.<br /><br /></span></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><span style="font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"> Great project! I was wondering: Do you offer any sort of purchase protections after a transaction is finalized? For example, a buyer orders an expensive item. Buyer receives it and everything looks good so escrow is released. They later find out the item is fake and want a refund. Is there any sort of dispute process for a scenario like this?</span></div>

Is there any sort of dispute process for a scenario like this?<br /></span></div><br /><span style="font-size: 16pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"> We certainly understand how this could become an issue at times. We don&#039;t want to provide any unnecessary delays in funds being released to the seller, since a common complaint from other centralized marketplaces is that sellers funds are held for long periods of time. And these long holds make sellers not want to use the services of these sites in many cases. Therefore, we encourage buyers to ensure that what they receive is as advertised (including authentication of goods if necessary) before releasing the escrow to the seller. For new sellers, or for sellers with lower feedback ratings, we are contemplating adding a delay time of somewhere between a few days and a week from when escrow is released to when the seller actually receives the funds. As an extra precaution to protect buyers in case an issue like this arises. <br /><br />In the event the funds have already been released to the seller but the buyer can provide proof that the goods or services they received are not as advertised, the buyer still has a right to open a dispute and have it adjudicated in their favor. After which we can ask the seller to accept a return of the merchandise in exchange for a refund. If the seller were to not comply, their account would be suspended. It is important to note that if the funds have already been released to the seller, buyers will have a higher burden of proof in order to have a dispute decided in their favor. Because we don&#039;t want to unfairly force sellers to provide refunds if the funds have already been released to them and the transaction is finalized. How we handle this type of issue may also be addressed by our voting system. Where the token holders can vote on how they feel this particular issue should be handled. If users feel our method of handling this situation could be improved.</span></div>

I would like to understand the future prospects of the project. I really like it.<br /></div><br /><span style="font-size: 16pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"> This is correct. If the ICO does not sell out, we would prefer that the tokens be burned rather than allowing them to be retained by team members as many other platforms do. Because this oftentimes gives the team significant ownership of the platform and thus makes it more centralized. Some of the main future prospects we have are expanding the services we offer through adding additional features to the platform such as our planned Ethbay Services marketplace to buy, sell, and trade services as well as a Classifieds section to to buy and sell locally using Ethereum. <br /><br />Some other planned site features we haven&#039;t mentioned on our website (because we&#039;re in the very early stages of planning for these features) include a pawn shop based service (Ethbay Pawn) where users can quickly obtain collateral backed Ethereum loans or quickly sell their merchandise for Ethereum without having to wait for a buyer on the main marketplace as well as an Ethereum based rental service (Ethbay Rentals) which will provide a marketplace specifically dealing with rentals of any item from one user to another, with rental agreements protected through our escrow service. We are also currently seeking some major business partnerships in order to further expand the services we are able to offer as well as provide these services on a mainstream level. Although I&#039;m not allowed to disclose any partnerships that are currently being sought. <br /><br />In the future, we also plan to provide a fully decentralized escrow service of our making to encourage both parties involved in a transaction to live up their agreement. Without the need for a third party to ever intervene. Because we want all features of our platform to be fully decentralized to live up to the blockchain theme of decentralization. We already have a few different decentralized escrow plans that we are currently testing and optimizing. Our current escrow service is in place to cater more to the mainstream public and encourage mass adoption. Since we have found that the general public would prefer an escrow service NOT to be fully decentralized because they prefer the normal dispute mechanisms in place by other online marketplaces for purchase protection. Through our own studies we&#039;ve conducted, we currently believe a fully decentralized dispute process would not receive mass adoption.<br /><br /><br /><br /></span></div>

If we receive an email inquiry asking for the ICO address, we will provide the link to the spot on our official website where the ICO address is (note: it should be easy to navigate to without having to contact us).

Any airdrops will be announced on our website with information on how to participate. We currently do not have plans for Ethbay to have masternodes since the main cryptocurrency the platform intends to deal with is Ethereum when making transactions. However, this is likely to change in the future since we do plan to implement the acceptance of the Ethbay cryptocurrency on the platform when making purchases. Once this happens and the Ethbay cryptocurrency reaches a value that will make it a good usable form of money when making purchases, this would be the time we would place more focus on improving Ethbay as a currency through instant transactions, etc. </span></div>
