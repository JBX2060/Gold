					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Recent Firefox versions overwrite the data when deleting browsing history.<br /><br />The chance to recover is very small. Better chances of success is providing the Instawallet owner with information that only You know (such as access to Bitcoin Fog account from what the coins is sent) and that cannot be harvested from blockchain or some other source to prove that it is you who sent the transaction.</div>

Giving Instawallet admin access to the Bitcoin Fog account to see history will show that You have sent the coins.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Useless for your current situation, but possibly useful knowledge for future use of instawallet...<br /><br />After playing around with the instawallet URL a bit it appears that the site will accept any 31 character alphanumeric string and produce a useable bitcoin address.&nbsp; So if you are only briefly storing your coins there with plans to forward them on somewhere else rather quickly, and you are willing to accept the risk of using a URL that isn&#039;t randomly generated, you could come up with your own (easier to memorize) URL.<br /><br />Examples that seem to work (Probably best not to use these now that I&#039;ve posted them here, but you get the idea, just come up with your own string easy for you to remember):<br /><br />https://instawallet.org/w/bitcoinbitcoinbitcoinbitcoinbit<br />https://instawallet.org/w/1111111111111111111111111111111<br />https://instawallet.org/w/0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstu<br />https://instawallet.org/w/IamANidiotFORusingAguessableURL</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It may be possible to boot off a forensic live CD such as Deft Linux (http://www.deftlinux.net/about/), mount the raw disk partition, and scan the entire drive for &quot;instawallet.org/w&quot;. If the url was written anywhere on the disk (even page file) and not properly erased, this may discover it.<br /><br /><a href="http://i1-linux.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/DEFT_4.jpg">http://i1-linux.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/DEFT_4.jpg</a></div>
