You probably won&#039;t get it back anymore. The 1xbet/1xbit sites have multiple scam accusations recorded on this forum since early 2017. (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=910922)<br />You can check the list I provided below for other accusations:<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1792608.0<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1957236.0<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1792648.0<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1780490.0<br /><br />Unluckily, we don&#039;t have access on the details of the person who owned that website/s.<br />I tried to check it but they are using a whoisguard service. <br /><br />The only thing I could suggest to you is to be very careful next time. <br />You should have check it first before using/playing, like using a search engine to look for &quot;Name of site + scam&quot;. If there&#039;s a lot of unresolved accusations - stay away.<br />_______________________________________________________________________________<span style="width: 0; margin: 0 -0.6ex 0 -1px;"> </span>___________________________________<br /><br />BTW if you have the time, please edit your post. Always use the proper format and add all valid details you have for future references.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">[b][color=black]What happened:: [/color][/b]<br /><br />[b][color=black]Scammers Profile Link: [/color][/b] <br /><br />[b][color=black]Reference Link: [/color][/b]<br />[b][color=black]Amount Scammed: [/color][/b]<br />[b][color=black]Payment Method: [/color][/b]<br />[b][color=black]Proof of Payment: [/color][/b]<br />[b][color=black]PM/Chat Logs: [/color][/b]<br />[b][color=black]Additional Notes: [/color][/b]</div></div>

What did you do that may have triggered them to not pay you out that may be in violation of their terms and conditions, or are they just not withdrawing funds for absolutely no reason at all apparently?<br /><br />We need more proof, before anyone can help you.<br /><br />But if you&#039;ve answered all their demands and they&#039;re still not paying you out that&#039;s just crazy. I don&#039;t know how they&#039;re getting away with this, but they&#039;re definitely not by any means a trusted place to play at anymore. They&#039;ve got multiple accusations opened against them last year and their business is almost dead(along with their sister site 1xbit).</div>
