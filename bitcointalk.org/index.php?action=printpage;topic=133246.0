					Post by: <b>gweedo</b> on <b>December 25, 2012, 06:55:59 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So I started rewriting my trading bot to be optimized and to implement new trading strategies, so I thought at first that it was cause I was getting the USD and BTC funds in my account then executing a trade and that I had a web socket connection open all at the same time. Then I rewrote the entire way I handle Mt Gox so I can make 2 calls back to back almost every 25 seconds (to be in the 10 seconds window so I am not caught by anti-DDOS measures), then I am only checking USD and BTC funds during startup, after a trade but after my open orders close. But it is always hitting this wall at 6 hours and needs to be turned off for a while before being startup right now it is all simulations (no trade is actually going thru) but I need to fix this before turning on for a live trading. Any help?<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to shut it down and restart it, with weird cron scripts, this is written in java</div>
