Thanks to all our contributors, supporters and partners throughout the token sale campaign. We can&#039;t wait to start changing the world with our technology.<br /><br />The CommerceBlock platform is a commerce ecosystem that lowers legal, administrative and transaction costs by leveraging smart contract technology. CommerceBlock reduces third party risk and secures transactions by using a public blockchain in combination with cryptographic technology which privately embeds auditable trade details and business logic into transactions. &nbsp;CommerceBlock has implemented a key derivation scheme that provably embeds data on the Bitcoin blockchain in a zero knowledge fashion.<br /><br />The advanced techniques privately secure and makes auditable the trade and finance details, ultimately allowing for a more reliable and automated trade flows to emerge. &nbsp;This negates the need to for private blockchains or unnecessary data storage on a blockchain and opens up public blockchains to use cases in finance that were not previously possible.<br /><br />The CBT tokens are based on Ethereum ERC20 and are designed to access and execute services on the CommerceBlock platform.</div><br /><br /><div align="center">Whitepaper - https://www.commerceblock.com/commerceblock-whitepaper.pdf (https://www.commerceblock.com/commerceblock-whitepaper.pdf)<br />Website - https://www.commerceblock.com/ (https://www.commerceblock.com/)<br />Telegram - https://t.me/joinchat/Ge36IURXhKAS_6HTznUXUg (https://t.me/joinchat/Ge36IURXhKAS_6HTznUXUg)<br />Twitter - https://twitter.com/commerceblock (https://twitter.com/commerceblock)<br />LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/company/11206988/ (https://www.linkedin.com/company/11206988/)<br />Github - https://github.com/commerceblock (https://github.com/commerceblock)<br />Medium - https://medium.com/@commerceblock (https://medium.com/@commerceblock)<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CommerceBlock (https://www.facebook.com/CommerceBlock)<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/8fHbyJo.png">https://i.imgur.com/8fHbyJo.png</a> (https://player.vimeo.com/video/208855743)<br /><br /><br />Whitepaper:<br />Indonesian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Unggahrizki)<br />https://www.dropbox.com/s/6biquliv8d19lfd/WHITEPAPER%20COMMERCEBLOCK.pdf?dl=0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Portugese&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ismart1)<br />https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6d6bzKey1dFUmluUVdBVnJLMGs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />ANN Thread:<br />Hindi (ankit10)<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2245143.new#new<br />Vietnamese (nakata90)<br />https://bitcoingarden.org/forum/index.php?topic=20863.new#new<br />Portuguese (ismart1)<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2281072.0<br />Spanish (bongiu)<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2314256<br />Arabic (Sigmas55)<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2555333.new;topicseen#new<br />Croatian (egetrorx)<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2432801.msg24913420#msg24913420<br />Hindi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(luv2709)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2422503.0<br />Filipino (gioangelofelix)<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2333079<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/9Di4GO0.png">https://i.imgur.com/9Di4GO0.png</a> (https://www.commerceblock.com)<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Thanks for your interest!</b><br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to check out our whitepaper - https://www.commerceblock.com/commerceblock-whitepaper.pdf (https://www.commerceblock.com/commerceblock-whitepaper.pdf) and website - https://www.commerceblock.com/ (https://www.commerceblock.com/)<br /><br /><br /></div><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The fact that this project has gone under the radar is going to play out very nicely for investors.&nbsp; 70% of ICO tokens burned, and I heard a rumour about a potential partnership announcement post-ICO.<br /><br />Dont get shaken out after token hits the exchange.&nbsp; This one is worth holding and enjoying how it plays out.</div>

Just found the new thread; mprep is really over extending the interpretation of &quot;No Give Aways&quot; in this situation. Did he charge a fine to reopen the thread? The bounty program ended days ago so there really was no reason to flag the old thread and there wasn&#039;t the level of &quot;shilling&quot; that we normally see in other threads. I only recognized genuine project supporters. Anyway, moving forward, I guess the rules are meant to clean the forum of the chaos so we should appreciate the overwhelming diligence of our moderators, as long as they&#039;re not using the rules to extort &quot;payments.&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been looking at projects similar to CommerceBlock, scouting out the competition, and I think that this project has that one ingredient the other&#039;s are missing - a realistic game plan with an organically organized community. The other&#039;s are either privatizing there platforms into collusively organized networks or making grandiose claims about their capabilities. The way CommerceBlock tokenizes it&#039;s platform will intrinsically galvanize its network while the competitors are going to have problems securing theirs.<br /><br /><br />Merry Christmas all!</div>

Efficiency: sidechain fees model is flexible, owners can use their own native token or bitcoin or CBT as a &quot;gas&quot;, the fees are set to make it competitive, and since this POS based rather POW, it&#039;s much cost effective.<br />3.

Sucks that there&#039;s so little liquidity because I would love to increase my ICO stack. I guess you guys will need to work with offchain data as well. Look into Chainlink (https://www.smartcontract.com/) in case you require an oracle service. I&#039;m not affiliated and this is not a cheap shill that&#039;s why I won&#039;t praise it. DYOR and don&#039;t let the memes fool you.</div>
