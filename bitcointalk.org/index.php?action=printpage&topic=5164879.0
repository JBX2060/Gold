The user was given a total of 72 hours to provide sources as evidence but was not capable of doing so, despite repeated requests (refs: msg52808483 (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2057229.msg52808483#msg52808483), msg52810914 (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2057229.msg52810914#msg52810914), msg52816768 (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2057229.msg52816768#msg52816768)), as well as contradictory evidence. Clearly believes they can make unfounded accusations and use deflection tactics to avoid accountability. <br />(Continued) Neutral feedback left as this user is not at risk of trading with, but likely to make allegations without references that would be damaging to current or future scam accusations. Doesn&#039;t appear to understand that you can&#039;t make false accusations, even if a project is scam, or accused of such.</span><br /></div></div><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><i>[Page Archived (https://web.archive.org/web/20191021194122/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5164879)]</i></span></div>
