					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi, I was just trying to install bitcoin on a mac, I just downloaded the latest version from bitcoin.org. When I click on Bitcoin-Qt, The bitcoin icon bounces a couple times in my dock, then it goes away. I don&#039;t get any messages or anything.<br /><br />Any ideas on how to make it run?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is probably loading the block chain, which will take a Looooong time the first time you run the program. After that, it will only have to load the blocks since the last time you ran it. :) . <br /><br />Hit F3 (shows all windows) and you should see a small window with a picture of the &quot;wallet&quot;. <br /><br />Just let it go overnight. It may take several hours to load the first time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t see any windows open. You are saying that once I tell it to open, it does not even bring up a window until it loads the block chain? Not even something to say how far it has progressed? How do I even know it is doing anything?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The client has had some UI quirks the last couple of releases. Try this: Right click on the icon in the Dock and select &quot;Show/Hide Bitcoin&quot;</div>

For those people who are running linux: do you ever run into this sort of problem, where the hardware you have is unable to run updates to the operating system? Do you ever run into updates to programs that will no longer work on your system?</div>

Linux was originally designed to run on a 12 MHz i386DX, and the current version still does (though most modern distros with a GUI require a little bit more than that, typically a Pentium II with 128 MB of RAM). Pretty much every device that was ever supported in Linux is either still supported or has an old driver available that still works. One of the (many) reasons I use Linux is that I actually have some old hardware that is no longer supported by other operating systems.<br /><br />As for program updates requiring a newer version of the OS, that does sometimes happen, though it isn&#039;t a problem to keep the OS up to date, even on old hardware.</div>
