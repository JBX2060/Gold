Both your business and your investors/community will benefit from a lite wallet with a clean, intuitive UX. The lite client requires no blockchain download and is available as a Chrome or browser-based wallet, or an Android/iOS app. You might choose to white-label it and brand it for your users, but it’s ready to go right away.<br /><br />Built-in exchange. Waves’ decentralized exchange (DEX) is integrated with the desktop lite client, so you don’t have to worry about listing on conventional, centralized exchanges. There will always be somewhere for our holders to trade their token, right from day #1.&quot;<br /><br />Tomahawkcoin it&#039;s &nbsp;a coin directly backed by oil production, that in turn would create a bigger demand for our coin at the exchanges. It will also be priced at $0.05, or its USD equivalency in the currently wide and most popular used digital currency such as BTC Ethereum and Waves<br /><br />Our coin, Tomahawkcoin will not trade with any decimal points, since it cannot be exchanged for a 1 equal equity share of Tomahawk Exploration LLC, &nbsp;if it trades in a fraction of a coin, so all purchases and trades on Crypto Exchanges will take place in exact number of coins without any decimals .<br /><br />It&#039;s not required that owners of Tomahawkcoin convert their coins into equity, but as long as they own Tomahawkcoins they always will have that option.<br /><br />The more Tomahawkcoins owned, the more equity a person has in Tomahawk Exploration LLC.<br /><br /><b>Supply and Distribution</b><br /><br /><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*HpukhWk9fpehEgG2.">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*HpukhWk9fpehEgG2.</a><br /><br />We created 200,000,005 Tomahawkcoins, without the option of creating anymore (Re-Issuable=False), 5 extra coins were made for testing transactions, which were a complete success.<br /><br /><br />The total Tomahawkcoin number will be set at 200,000,000 coins, and our intention is to have the coin trade on all applicable exchanges for at least 18 months, the time needed for the company to start generating value..<br /><br />Total supply 200,000,005 Tomahawkcoins<br /><br />50% &nbsp;or 100,000,000 Tomahawkcoins for Crowdsale<br />1% or 2,000,000 Tomahawkcoin reserved for Bounties<br />24% or 48,000,000 reserved for salaries, marketing, advertising, Board of directors<br />25% or 50,000,000 reserved for business acquisitions and market liquidity.<br />5 Tomahawkcoins already burned.<br /><br /><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*koh8eo6nW3FHgjA5.">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*koh8eo6nW3FHgjA5.</a><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*jbcpc2cEmYDRVPPa.">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*jbcpc2cEmYDRVPPa.</a><br /><br /><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*lhrz3RrPNjeUTPQB.">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*lhrz3RrPNjeUTPQB.</a><br /><br />No Bonus<br /><br />Goal- $5,000,000 USD<br /><br />Acceptance $500,000 USD<br /><br /><b>Tomahawkcoin</b> is available for purchase at <b>DEX on WAVES wallet</b>,all anyone needs is the Waves Wallet installed.<br /><br />Our coin is verified and has earned a <b>Green Check</b> mark, Waves Platform strongly advises against coins built on their platform that have no <b>Green Check</b>, since they are not verified.<br /><br />Verification includes personal address of DEV, email verification and team verification credentials.<br /><br /><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*MO1vOLHQGQjGWSrRZ_x1dg.png">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*MO1vOLHQGQjGWSrRZ_x1dg.png</a><br /><br /><b>Download Waves Wallet Lite App</b><br />https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wavesliteapp/kfmcaklajknfekomaflnhkjjkcjabogm<br /><br /><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*T8HfGnbMxCE8EN4E.PNG">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*T8HfGnbMxCE8EN4E.PNG</a><br /><br /><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*rvui3elnWn4bNzI1.jpeg">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*rvui3elnWn4bNzI1.jpeg</a><br /><br />http://wavescommunity.com/category/news/<br /><br /><br /><b>Get some FREE Waves from Waves based Tokens faucet</b><br /><br />https://wavesdrop.com/<br /><br /><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*44OUtxg353TQe4p8.PNG">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*44OUtxg353TQe4p8.PNG</a><br /><br /><b>Block Explorer Tomahawkcoin on WavesGo</b><br />http://www.wavesgo.com/account.html?3PKthEA4A24ipXpAA8Hh7B9ydfzYKS6Dpp5<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important;

therefore, only half or 50%, 100,000,000 Tomahawkcoins will be sold to potential investors, as the other remaing coins will be used for marketing, advertising, and the creation of better liquidity on the coin traded exchange and percentage ownership of the Board of Directors and employees’ salaries that will work with the company towards our goal of creating value for our stakeholders and future shareholders in Tomahawk Exploration LLC or the Company. <br /><br />The estimated price of $0.05 USD price per Tomahawkcoin is based on the IPO (Initial Public Offering) price expectation of the Company set to start trading on the OTC Market at no less than $0.05, and 200,000,000 shares outstanding. Due to the volatility of market conditions, known fluctuations in capital markets, changes in economic variables, and risk inherent to the energy sector, there is no guarantee as to price and / or timing which is subject to change. There is no guarantee, implied, or otherwise, as far as, the price of Tomahawkcoin is concerned on any currency traded exchange, since the parity of which Tomahawkcoin will trade for, and against, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and / or Waves, have no set price, and no price guarantee in any way or form, due to the constant price volatility of these coins, known to carry their own risk of losing USD value.<br /><br />The time horizon of 18 months is fundamental to the initial ICO, whereas ICO capital will be used to place Tomahawk Exploration LLC &nbsp;(The Company) into a profitable company and fund the cost of drilling the 10 wells available.<br /><br />The bold ICO price objective and confident time horizon goal of 18 months is based on the legitimacy of Tomahawk Exploration LLC, an oil &amp; gas exploration company, managed by David Laurance.<br /><br /><br /><b>Business details</b><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Tomahawk Exploration LLC proposal</span> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7BA7703vYuOUllvdncxM1RacGc/view?usp=sharing<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tomahawk Exploration LLC decisive factors</span> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7BA7703vYuOWGhNRzV6RUtUNUU/view?usp=sharing<br /><br />Only $500,000 USD will get the company needed funds to commence drilling on two wells, sufficient to generate enough profits and <br />allow the company to open more wells for production.<br /><br />Obviously, if only $500,000 is raised less shareholder will have their hands in Tomahawk Exploration LLC, that&#039;s not to say that we are not allowed to have the ICO opened until we reach a decent goal, but nevertheless, more equity owners less profits spread among the group.<br /><br />&nbsp;Tomahawk Exploration LLC can make money as low as $20 per bbl , so how can we sit by and let events out of our control dictate our business future. Oil demand is increasing World Wide with the 2,000,000 bbls a day surplus being narrowed every year by a combination of our peak being reached and with China and India continuing their growth. The world will always be full of strife and all we need to do is keep going.<br /><br />Thankfully the actual price per barrel is approaching $50 and shows no indication of dropping since the US oil reserves are at it&#039;s lowest ever, also recent announcement by Trump administration will implement and reinforce restrictions and reductions on importing oil from Venezuela due to recent political events disrupting Venezuela&#039;s progress based on a current Dictatorship, as referred to by Donald J. Trump.<br /><br />We also have received an offer from a prestigious Private Financial firm in New York as follows, if Tomahawkcoin ICO is able to raise a minimum of $1 Mil USD in cryptocurrency value, they will commit $10 Mil USD from their portfolio assuring Tomahawk Exploration LLC success.<br /><br />Due to aggreements between both parties, we are not allowed to disclose detailed information regarding the firm&#039;s name, but as soon as the goal in discussion is met, the company will make such agreements available for public view.<br /><br />So with all these factors in place the price per barrel is going to move higher, although not good news for consumers, but great news for investors.<br /><br /><b>How will Tomahawk utilize the oil yields? </b><br /><br />There are many other Exploration opportunities to look at with the profits generated from this field. If our business is oil then we would naturally continue to grow the company in the oil sector. There are many companies using several &quot;Steam Flood&quot; methods in California if the oil is either very shallow (500ft) or the oil is thick and hard to pump. The oil in our field can be easily pumped. In the future, when our initial pressure naturally declines, we can utilize a Steam Flood where steam is injected into several wells to both heat and thin the oil and build up pressure to reinvigorate the production to even more than the initial production rates. It would also greatly increase our ultimate recoverable reserves.<br /><br />How will Tomahawk sell the crude? When we announce a Discovery there are at least 6 large Oil Brokers knocking at our door trying to get a contract to purchase our oil. They would then pick up oil on site and truck it to refineries or pipelines surrounding Bakersfield. About a 30-50 mile trip. We would get about a $1.50bbl haircut for the Transportation cost.<br /><br />Let&#039;s get into the number factors a little deeper regarding Tomahawk Exploration LLC success.<br /><br /><b>I will try to make it quick about our project. </b><br /><br />We are not &quot;Fracking&quot;. Fracking is usually for Shale zones which are very brittle and hard to produce from a vertical well. Fracking is when a well is drilled to the Shale Oil zone and redirected at a 90 degree angle for as much as a mile thru the shale zone which may be several hundred feet thick. <br /><br />Shale has oil and gas trapped in a very hard zone which needs to be cracked or &quot;Fractured&quot; to give the oil and gas an avenue to escape thru the cracks formed from the injection of sand and chemicals into the mile long &quot;leg&quot; in the Shale. <br /><br />A well may cost $4,000,000 to $6,000,000 each and payout in less than a year. The 2nd years production would drop by 50% and 50% each year afterwards. Our wells decline only 10% to 15% each year after the first because we are in a very permeable sand formation. <br />Tomahawk should recover net to our interest approx. 80,000 bbls per well. If we use a low figure of $40 per bbl that nets us $3,200,000 per well if oil never goes above $40 per bbl. I predict low $50&#039;s in 2018. The Tomahawk wells will cost appox $500,000 each with oil flowing into the tanks. &nbsp;<br /><br />Using our finding cost of $500,000 and finding 80,000bbls shows we are finding oil for $6.25 per bbl. Producing oil at $6.25 and selling for at least $40 should give us a very healthy profit. I really believe that with a future Steamflood we should get at least 200,000 net bbls per well for a profit of $80,000,000 at $40bbl. A Steamflood would inject steam into the formation and flush a lot more oil out (Up to 300bopd).<br /><br />I hope this can clarify Tomahawks position on these matters. Remember, oil and it&#039;s derivatives (gasoline, diesel, plastics, medicines, fertilizers, many chemicals, lubrications and countless others) will be needed long after our lifetime. We appreciate your interest in Tomahawkcoin and our future. Hopefully together.<br /><br /><b>So, what are the projected revenues after drilling? </b><br /><br />The Company expects more than $500,000 USD to be generated by each well per year based on the reserve reports:<br />10 wells x $500,000 = $5,000,000 a year revenue projection<br /><br />Our initial plan was to transition from an already Private company to a Public traded one.<br /><br />But amidst recent news regarding the SEC targeting recently announced ICO&#039;s, we decided to best avoid them by staying Private, thus equity owned by our investors would not be subjected to SEC rules and regulations and only state regulations.<br /><br />The company will also implement a Coin Buy Back program in the future from these exchanges, which remains to be determined based on revenues and profits generated by the company<br /><br />The business plan provided by the Company is believed to increase the demand for Tomahawkcoin on digital currency exchange markets, such as Bittrex, Poloniex, and others, since ownership equals equity share equivalency, more coins, more voting power and company stake ownership.<br /><b><br />About Kern County California</b> <br />Oil Production in Kern County, California https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/case-study/oil-production-kern-county-california<br />Kern River Oil Field https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2cmCtdhm4&amp;feature=youtu.be<br /><br />The Kern River Oil Field in south-central California. Other oil fields are shown in gray.<br /><br />Kern River Oil Field aerial, 2012.<br />The Kern River Oil Field is a large oil field in Kern County in the San Joaquin Valley of California, north-northeast of Bakersfield in the lower Sierra foothills. Yielding a cumulative production of close to 2 billion barrels (320,000,000 m3) of oil by the end of 2006, it is the third largest oil field in California, after the Midway-Sunset Oil Field and the Wilmington Oil Field, and the fifth largest in the United States.[1] Its estimated remaining reserves, as of the end of 2006, were around 476 million barrels (75,700,000 m3), the second largest in the state. It had 9,183 active wells, the second highest in the state.[2] The principal operator on the field is Chevron Corporation[3]<br /><br />Geographic setting<br />Kern River Oil Field; view from Panorama Park in Bakersfield, on the blufftop across the river. This is the most densely developed oilfield in California, and the fifth-largest producer (as of 2006) in the US.<br />The Kern River Oil Field covers an area of 10,750 acres (43.5 km2) in a rough oval extending over the low hills north-northeast of Bakersfield, hills which are now almost completely barren except for oil rigs, drilling pads and associated equipment. This area is the densest operational oil development in the state of California: Midway-Sunset, which has more wells, is almost three times as large in surface area, for a lower overall density. Elevations on the Kern River Oil Field range from approximately 400 to 1,000 feet (300 m), rising towards the northeast, and the Kern River flows south of the field, from east to west, from the Sierra Nevada into the city of Bakersfield.<br />The oil field is one of many contiguous oil fields along the eastern edge of the southern San Joaquin Valley, lying between the Kern Front field to the northwest and the Kern Bluff field to the southeast, on the other side of the Kern River. Directly north of the Kern River field is the large Mount Poso Oil Field, entirely in the Sierra foothills, and to the northeast is the Round Mountain Oil Field.<br /><br />Kern County produces 66% of the oil in California, about 10% of the U.S. oil supply, and approximately 1% of the world&#039;s total oil production. That works out to about 560,000 barrels of oil per day, which at $12 to $15 per barrel is something like$2.4 billion to $3.0 billion worth of oil every year.<br /><br /><b>About Us</b><br /><br />We have made sure that our team and Board of Directors are refined successful citizens with flawless backgrounds, verifiable credentials, heroes, public activists, and skilled individuals with great experience in both business and digital currency<br /><br /><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*srr7oIW_xNtzvbbC.">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*srr7oIW_xNtzvbbC.</a><br /><b><br />President / CEO, Tomahawk Exploration LLC</b><br />Is an experienced oil and gas exploration veteran with over 40 years participating in drilling over 300 wells in 11 states in the United States and internationally: Canada, Colombia, Indonesia, and Oman.<br /><br />Mr. David Laurance remains firm on his position of environmental accountability in the oil and gas exploration industry.

With a solid business plan and business model, designed to maintain and thereby increase the initial value of the ICO. We are distinct from Paycoin and other failed promises hidden behind virtual currencies in the past which had no business plan and highly priced from the gate, Tomahawkcoin will be priced at $0.05, or it&#039;s USD equivalency in the currently wide and most popular used digital currency, such as Dogecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple.<br /><br />2. &nbsp; The total Tomahawkcoin number will be set at 200,000,000 coins, and our intention is to have the coin trade on all applicable exchanges.<br /><br />3. &nbsp; The bold ICO price objective and confident time horizon goal of 18 months is based on the legitimacy of Tomahawk Exploration LLC, an oil &amp; gas exploration company, managed by David Laurance and registered in Nevada with HQ in California.<br /><br />4.The time horizon of 18 months is fundamental to the initial ICO, whereas ICO capital will be used to place Tomahawk Exploration LLC (The Company) into a publicly traded company on the OTC Market and fund the cost of drilling the 10 wells available.<br /><br />5. &nbsp;The Company will transition from private to public in approximately 10 to 18 months and drilling is expected to commence in 6 to 10 months. After the 18-month holding period, all ICO owners of Tomahawkcoin are eligible to exchange Tomahawkcoin for the equivalent value in share(s) of the public Company priced at the close of market on the day of conversion.<br /><br />6. &nbsp;The estimated price of $0.05 USD price per Tomahawkcoin is based on the IPO (Initial Public Offering) price expectation of the Company set to start trading on the OTC Market at no less than $0.05, 200,000,000 shares outstanding. Due to the volatility of market conditions, known fluctuations in capital markets, changes in economic variables, and risk inherent to the energy sector, there is no guarantee as to price and / or timing which is subject to change. There is no guarantee, implied, or otherwise, as to the price on Tomahawkcoin on any traded exchange. Tomahawkcoin, traded as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin or Dogecoin, whereas there is no set price, no price guarantee and there is no control, in any way, of the price volatility of these coins, which have a risk of losing USD value.<br /><br />7. &nbsp; Tomahawk Exploration LLC capital requirement is $5,000,000 to commence drilling and thereto function with ease and without restriction towards the main target of exchange listing as a public entity; therefore, only half or 50%, 100,000,000 Tomahawkcoins will be sold to potential investors, as the other half will be used for marketing, advertising, and the creation of better liquidity on the coin traded exchange and percentage ownership of the Board of Directors and employees’ salaries that will work with the company towards our goal of creating value for our stakeholders and future shareholders in Tomahawk Exploration LLC or the Company. <br /><br />8. &nbsp;There are no conversion requirements; however, those that choose not to exchange their Tomahawkcoins after 18 months into shares of the Company, may continue trading their Tomahawkcoins freely, as they do not expire. Whereas, they have the option to make their exchange at a later date, days and / or even years later.<br /><br />9. &nbsp; The business plan provided by the Company is believed to increase the demand for Tomahawkcoin on digital currency exchange markets, such as Bittrex, Poloniex, and others. Pre-IPO ownership is exclusively available and may only be obtained prior to the public registration of the Company through Tomahawkcoin purchase and no other way. Coin and share equivalency: Additional Tomahawkcoins into the market may be exchanged for additional shares of the publicly traded Company.<br /><br />10. &nbsp;, We have made sure that our team and Board of Directors are refined successful citizens with flawless backgrounds, verifiable credentials, heroes, public activists, and skilled individuals with great experience in both business and digital currency. We sincerely hope that our solid business proposal and community established trust will make this venture great and a complete success that will lead to future projects and profitable prospects.<br /><br />11. &nbsp; &nbsp;The information contained herein, while obtained from sources believed to be reliable, is not guaranteed as to its accuracy or completeness.

The Company expects more than $500,000 USD to be generated by each well per year based on the reserve reports:<br />10 wells x $500,000 = $5,000,000 a year revenue projection<br /><br />The team at Tomahawk Exploration LLC thanks everyone for their support, and God Bless us all!<br /><a href="http://mediaprocessor.websimages.com/width/920/crop/0,47,920x624/www.tomahawkcoin.com/Tomahawk%20plan00.jpg">http://mediaprocessor.websimages.com/width/920/crop/0,47,920x624/www.tomahawkcoin.com/Tomahawk%20plan00.jpg</a><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>

I mean amazing!!!!<br /><br />All the years I have been involved in Crypto and I have to say that the people involved in this project like David Laurance, Rick Shaddock and 2009 New York Hero Award Winner Horia Cretan &#039;Billy from the Bronx&#039; are truly the best of the best. Please take a minute and look at this youtube of Horia Cretan on Ellen after saving a Childs life from a burning building. We live our whole lives hoping to do something great and Horia Cretan handles it like its just another day. Hey Billy is that kid in College now or what? <br />Youtube- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1_982A0lE0<br /><br />Mr. Laurance is the reason why California is going to have good fertile soil and clean water in a 100 years and not be a dead zone like Wyoming and North Dakota from all the left over condensent and salt water sludge caused by greedy fracking practices and uneducated wildcats just destroying the Mid West. Not in California on David Laurances watch, because Mr. Laurance is highly educated and experienced in the most effective methods of extraction of precious resources and knows how to do it within the most narrowest possible effects to the terrain without disturbing any life, flora &amp; Fauna. This is because David Laurance is a lifelong environmentalist and as a professionally educated Geologist has spent his life fighting for nature and the environment and is the only person that I am aware of that actually implemented proven methodologies and techniques allowing for nature and limited natural resource extraction and harvesting to be able to peacefully coexist. As a lifelong activist I know this because if you do what I used to do before joining Crypto in 2011, you know who the good guys and bad guys are, and David Laurance is a great guy.<br /><br />Rick Shaddock is the CEO of the &#039;Association for Digital Currency&#039; in Washington DC with an office on K Street.

I mean amazing!!!!<br /><br />All the years I have been involved in Crypto and I have to say that the people involved in this project like David Laurance, Rick Shaddock and 2009 New York Hero Award Winner Horia Cretan &#039;Billy from the Bronx&#039; are truly the best of the best. Please take a minute and look at this youtube of Horia Cretan on Ellen after saving a Childs life from a burning building. We live our whole lives hoping to do something great and Horia Cretan handles it like its just another day. Hey Billy is that kid in College now or what? <br />Youtube- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1_982A0lE0<br /><br />Mr. Laurance is the reason why California is going to have good fertile soil and clean water in a 100 years and not be a dead zone like Wyoming and North Dakota from all the left over condensent and salt water sludge caused by greedy fracking practices and uneducated wildcats just destroying the Mid West. Not in California on David Laurances watch, because Mr. Laurance is highly educated and experienced in the most effective methods of extraction of precious resources and knows how to do it within the most narrowest possible effects to the terrain without disturbing any life, flora &amp; Fauna. This is because David Laurance is a lifelong environmentalist and as a professionally educated Geologist has spent his life fighting for nature and the environment and is the only person that I am aware of that actually implemented proven methodologies and techniques allowing for nature and limited natural resource extraction and harvesting to be able to peacefully coexist. As a lifelong activist I know this because if you do what I used to do before joining Crypto in 2011, you know who the good guys and bad guys are, and David Laurance is a great guy.<br /><br />Rick Shaddock is the CEO of the &#039;Association for Digital Currency&#039; in Washington DC with an office on K Street. Rick a former US Marine trained both Military and Civilian Employees at the Pentagon for years as a career. He worked for the &#039;World Bank&#039; at one point and even a few years at the NSA. Rick Shaddock is well known for his character and integrity plus has been an anti-war activist and has stood up to his former employers now that he is retired and spoke out against the Governments Official Conspiracy Theory regarding 9/11 and has called them out for answers.

However I would of tried to point it out in a better way or PM and if I liked the project and clearly seen a lot of zeros I would just fix it myself. As a Hero Member I would think you would be glad to see real people show up here with real companies with past proven track records with a Crypto that is backed by 100 Oil wells needing funding for extraction equipment. These people are real and want to fund their company and share the profits with regular folks. We need to support projects like this that have respected businessmen and real assets behind those tokens if we want Crypto to ever really be mainstream. David Laurance probably looks at your comment and says to himself &quot;Lord what have I got myself into&quot; because he now associates &#039;Hero Members&#039; as people that bounce in the forum and sarcasm as a way to welcome regular folks, take them down a notch, and do them a favor by letting them and the world know that maybe the least important aspect of his project might of been slightly rushed. I hope when you return to this [ANN] Thread that you find a better way of welcoming Mr. Laurance to Crypto than that and if you must sling or chop at the knees either do it privately or use the skills I know you have to do it right, and if you want to make some real money because I know you missed out on Bitcoin and my guess ether also, send me a PM. I have a couple perspectives to bounce off you regarding this project and two other peaces to a puzzle your aware of and how they compliment each other.</div>

The difference between a troll like you and a paid troll that is spreading FUD as a job and for personal lowlife self gain is this. A paid troll spreading FUD at the end of the day is just a piece of shit lame ass troll. You troll for free and talk to hear your head rattle all day. However at the end of the day your trolling is precise, accurate, truthful and in a strange way supportive yet your not paid but actually perform a service that is beneficial and professional. I say this from a knowledge perspective reading your last 100 posts in the hopes of bouncing you and your translated back to Indonesia fast, praying you might engage me in one of my 10 Newbie accounts with creation dates here on BitcoinTalk going back as far as 2011 in the usual undefeated fashion. However if you continue to troll these projects for another 100 posts with the same work ethic and engagement I believe your more valuable to Crypto doing what your doing here in this industry than teaching English, Making Shoes, Cooking Fish Soup or god forbid slinging shaboo or betting numbers. Thank you for the support this thread will be remodeled and &#039;yours&#039; and that &#039;Hero Member&#039; above honesty is really appreciated both you guys PM me so I can return the favor. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I believe we have made a great decision on the platform choice for Tomahawkcoin, since wallets for Ethereum Based Tokens are difficult to work with, if anyone takes a peek at Waves platform would soon realize is the next best thing.<br /><br />Coin transfer is fast, the wallet is a very light app and user friendly, and transaction fees are cheap.<br /><br />&quot;<b>User-friendly wallet. Both your business and your investors/community will benefit from a lite wallet with a clean, intuitive UX. The lite client requires no blockchain download and is available as a Chrome or browser-based wallet, or an Android/iOS app. You might choose to white-label it and brand it for your users, but it’s ready to go right away.<br /><br />Built-in exchange. Waves’ decentralised exchange (DEX) is integrated with the desktop lite client, so you don’t have to worry about listing on conventional, centralised exchanges. There will always be somewhere for your holders to trade your token, right from day #1.</b>&quot;<br /><br /><br />Our coin, Tomahawkcoin will not trade with decimal points, since it cannot be exchanged for a 1 equal share of Tomahawk Exploration LLC, if if trades in a quarter of a coin, so all purchases and trades on Crypto exchanges will take place in exact number of coins without any decimals, one person cannot purchase a half of coin or a third of it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We will announce a contest for maybe GIF Banners, coin logo and such, any suggestions are welcome, we are very transparent, i have to mention that and it&#039;s very important the community understands it, since many scams took place, and i personally got caught on myself, like Crypto Rush, Mint Pal, Cryptsy, Ebay, CEX with their Hash purchase, Bit Fish Group, Palth.net, my friend just lost 18 BTC on BitSilver, even Bittrex, my account on Bittrex got hacked and the person sold a lot of my coins to himself, Bittrex did not help with the issue at all, instead told me it cannot be reversible, since then i don&#039;t know if Bittrex should be a host for this coin but i think that would be something we&#039;ll have to take a vote on.<br /><br />I even had a very active blog on Cryptocointalk about scams and they removed it, even sent them a message about it and their response was:<br />&quot;I haven&#039;t touched the blogs in awhile. &nbsp;Not many people were using it and quite frankly it&#039;s not a major priority for me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Not changing anything.<br /><br />Best, <br />Jim&quot;<br /><br />And there you have it, never a shortage of Aholes.<br /><br />Even my Bitcointalk account was hacked during that time under horiacretan and horia2cretan, now i&#039;ve learned valuable lessons that can be applied to a better and more safe path to success for everyone.<br /><br />So over 6 years of being involved in the crypto world, i&#039;ve seen coins come and go with people&#039;s hard earned money, i despise that, and people like Fyrstikken and the CryptoRush group which i argued with on this site for a long time. Don&#039;t get me started on Paycoin and Big Vern from Cryptsy.<br /><br />We, and i personally found a solid way to keep the community created by Tomahawkcoin, safe and above the market with a real company registered in Nevada with a great group of outstanding citizens and a successful business plan.<br /><br />We really want to give back to this community that are true pioneers in the world of crypto, what better way then a consistent value for their investment.<br /><br />Not to bash other coins, but i&#039;m looking at Humaniq that have an idiotic business plan and was able to raise so much money, just ridiculous, making Bank accounts for homeless people without I.D. or access to internet, just horrific.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">New article regarding Tomahawkcoin<br /><br /><a href="https://coincompareblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/tomahawk01.png">https://coincompareblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/tomahawk01.png</a><br /><br /><b>TOMAHAWKCOIN ICO ANNOUNCEMENT</b><br /><br />https://microcapcrypto.com/tomahawkico/<br /><br />Crypto Currency Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) held in the past have developed a mixed reputation with investors. On one hand, high risk investors cannot stop buying these unproven coins and tokens which have been shown to be a way to make incredible profits. On the other hand, wary buyers are smart enough to realize many of the projects offer no real substance, and in many cases are relying on an uncertain future for success. Investors in the crypto community have become distrustful of these unproven concepts raising tens of millions of dollars, when only a small portion of those funds are actually required to get started.<br /><br />I invite you to picture a new professional brand of ICO. One where the costs have already been defined and the goal is to raise only the money needed to begin operations. An ICO where the business plan is available to read before investing and put together by a publicly accessible business team with verifiable credentials.<br /><br />More importantly, imagine an ICO promising investors the option to receive gift shares in the company tradable over the counter in a lucrative industry within eighteen months. Perhaps ICO in this particular case should stand for Initial Coin Ownership.<br /><br />Let me introduce you to Tomahawkcoin, and a new category of digital currency investment offering investors transparency, assurance and sincerity.<br /><br />Tomahawkcoin is the digital currency being offered by Tomahawk Exploration LLC, an oil and gas exploration company registered in Nevada (1) with headquarters in California. The company will raise $5 Million for the ICO, which will be used to drill ten wells in Kern County, California. A complete business plan detailing costs, rates of return and risks involved is available on the Tomahawk website.<br /><br />Within eighteen months after the completion of the ICO (and potentially sooner), Tomahawkcoin holders will be given the option of receiving gift shares (2) in exchange for their digital currency at a one for one exchange rate. Another option would be to keep your Tomahawkcoins and continue to trade them in the crypto markets.<br /><br />The expected revenue for each of the ten oil wells based on the company’s investigations is $500,000 (3). This brings the total for all ten wells to $5,000,000 per year, which will then be poured back into the company to further increase the value of its investor’s shares.<br /><br />The ICO price for Tomahawkcoins, and therefore shares in Tomahawk Exploration LLC, is set at .05 cents each. 100 million Tomahawkcoins will be sold at this price to raise just $5,000,000 to get the ten oil wells running. An additional 100 million coins will be used for marketing, bounties, employee salaries, ownership shares for the Board of Directors, and otherwise running the company, however, no additional superfluous funds will be raised in the ICO, and no further coins will ever be created in the future.<br /><br />Other Crypto ICO sales in the past, where untold millions of dollars were handed to an often anonymous group with little or no business experience and a vague plan of action, seem tremendously risky in comparison. The few people who will have the opportunity to buy Tomahawkcoins before the limited number are sold will be buying into a transparent operation with potential profits already defined.<br /><br />Don’t let this one article convince you though. Tomahawk Exploration LLC invites everyone to do their own research first. The company encourages investors to look at the materials already available, such as the Roadmap, Business Plan, Director Profiles and Business Registration. Please stop by the slack channel and ask the Chief Information Officer, Horia Cretan, your questions. All the links you need to help make your decision are below.<br /><br />Tomahawkcoin is expected to increase in value similar to other recent digital currency ICOs. However, the incredible advantage buying and holding will offer to early investors will be the opportunity to obtain shares in the actual company itself, which is expected to be worth millions in the coming years.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />(1) https://www.nvsilverflume.gov/businessSearch?currentPage=1&amp;sortOrder=ASCENDING&amp;phoneticMatch=false&amp;sortColumn=MatchRank&amp;businessSearchTerm=Tomahawk%20Exploration%20LLC&amp;searchType=ENTITY_NAME<br /><br />(2) https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-give-stock-as-a-gift-358132<br /><br />(3) https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7BA7703vYuOZ0J2VVJ6X3lNVWs/view</div>

According to the Department of Energy, at of June 30, the SPR had 682 million barrels of crude in it, after more than 10 million barrels were sold over the first five months of the year.<br /><br />Yet, there is no cause for concern: shale production, according to energy analysts, has created a comfortable cushion against potential shortages, and the U.S. simply does not need to store as much petroleum as it once did.<br /><br />“You only need 60 days of your net import of crude and products in the emergency stockpiles,” Macquarie Capital analyst Vikas Dwivedi told Bloomberg. “Given the fact that we don’t net import that much any more, we only really need 300 million barrels.”<br /><br />Daily U.S. oil imports for the week to June 23 averaged some 8 million barrels, and 8.1 million bpd was the average for the last four weeks, according to the Energy Information Administration’s last weekly petroleum data report.<br /><br />Total oil and product imports stood at 9.83 million bpd. Exports of crude and products averaged 5.6 million. Net crude oil and products imports for the week to June 23 stood at 4.23 million barrels. According to Bloomberg, this compared with a high of 14.4 million barrels daily in November 2005.<br />Related: The Downturn Is Over, But U.S. Oil Companies Face A Huge Problem<br />The Best Kept Secret Of The Marijuana Boom<br /><br />Canada’s Cannabis Boom is creating a $30 Billion Investment Opportunity for investors and this small company could explode upwards in the next few weeks as investors start to flock to the space.<br /><br />Click here to find out more<br />According to the Department of Energy, the SPR was at its highest at the end of December 2009, holding 727 million barrels of crude – equal to the capacity of the four storage sites.<br /><br />Earlier this year, at the presentation of his draft budget for 2018, President Trump included a proposal for the sale of around half of the SPR, for proceeds estimated at US$16.6 billion over a period of 10 years. If the shale industry continues to pump at a growing rate, a 50-percent reduction in the strategic petroleum reserves over a decade would hardly be felt.<br /><br />By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">TomahawkCoin Team,<br /><br />I want to congratulate you all for getting verified to trade and sell on the Waves Platform. This will make way for the successful raise in order to provide Mr Laurance and Company with the needed funding to get this certain ball rolling in the right direction. This in my opinion is an historic project for Crypto as it truly is in first place in regards to Crypto today clearly Bitcoin 3.0 and finally a Cryptocurrency that is not only Open Source and DeCentralized but asset backed which is truly one of only a handful of its kind like it and the only one to be backed by oil. Respectively and historically I am against big oil but in this unique case thanks to University Professor of Geology Mr. David Laurance I do not have a problem with his proven methodologies he developed for extracting natural resources such as oil which are proven to have an extremely low impact on the surrounding environment and the laws that he passed at the State level and beyond in California making &#039;Fracking&#039; like we see in Wyoming and North Dakota Illegal which he championed. So we truly are living in historic times and participating in an historic project while we usher in this new financial/Energy Economic Era together through Crypto. Truly honored to be here everyone!!! Lets Rock this project!!!!<br /><br />~jack</div>

I&#039;m just skeptical about project of this nature entering the space because the probability of failure is high <br /></div><br />I would love to answer your question, but 1st i would have to understand it, Blockchain question...what ?<br /><br />And where do you see failure in oil and petroleum exactly, we all drive cars, but not everyone buys coins.<br /><br />You can keep waiting on Zrcoin and Starta and many others, what they offer is a pipe and a dream, especially Starta.<br /><b><br />Starta business plan explained below:</b><br /><br />Starta wants to raise money, to fund start up companies (newbies without a name), and then hope they become successful, and then hope they are bought out by other companies, preferably US companies, that maybe are publicly listed on Nasdaq, then maybe when this scenario happens,...if it does,..then maybe they &nbsp;decide to use the profits to buy back the coin Starta at a higher price of 1o X or 20 X higher then what they sold it at their ICO.<br /><br />In other words, they are full of Kaka, and these claims could get them in jail really fast.<br /><br />What&#039;s more surprising is that, they really raised $5,000,000 with that story.<br /><br />Unreal<br /><br />And about ZrCoin, how much do you guys know about Zirconium and the cost per ton.<br /><br />The company behind ZrCoin is in Russia, Starta is in Singapore, our company in the US, you guys send value out of the country for no apparent reason.<br /><br />How can you, the coin holder benefit from a company listed overseas ? <br /><br />The answer is, you can&#039;t because every country has different regulations and laws, if they don&#039;t deliver can you sue them and get your investment back &nbsp;? No you can&#039;t, the claims on their business plan would be enough to get them in jail according to US laws, Red Bull got sued because it claimed It Gives You Wings, false advertisement.<br /><br />Keep the money home, all you guys do is make people rich in poor countries, ZrCoin business plan is calculated in Rubles not Dollars.<br /><br />Funny stuff.<br /><br />But i have to answer questions that are already explained in detail, and questions you guys never asked from others with fancy logos and &quot;cool websites&quot;, give me a break.<br /><br />Do they have a phone number you can call ?<br /><br />Of course they do, is in Russia.<br /><br />Legal Address: 32-224, Zeleny Log Str., Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk Region, 455034<br />Mailing Address: 32-224, Zeleny Log Str., Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk Region, 455034<br />E-mail: spc.zeolite@mail.ru<br />Phone/ Fax: +7 (3519) 29-03-75<br />INN: 455007210<br />KPP: 745501001<br />OKPO: 37907031<br /><br />Humaniq their business plan is to offer bank accounts to people all over the world that otherwise can&#039;t have the means, the money or even the necessary I.D. to even open a regular Bank account because they might be homeless or very poor.<br /><br />Explain that please, a person that has no home, no computer, no means to internet, no identity, no money, Humaniq will make sure they will have a virtual Bank account.<br />Funny part is ,....they raised $5,000,000 USD<br /><br />Humaniq was even delisted from icocountdown.com, they found a flaw on Humaniq <br /><br />https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/64ufyp/emission_due_diligence_for_humaniq/<br /><br />And with that said, i will share a nice video with everyone.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLpE1Pa8vvI&amp;feature=youtu.be</div>

The oil has already been proven to be there, there is a concise plan on what they are using the money for. You can trade these tokens, or hold them to exchange for gift shares eventually. How is the probability of failure high? <br /><br />To me, this is a no brainer. Gives a chance for everyday people to be involved in a multi million dollar oil operation.</div>

We take no position on the desirability of any particular proposal nor do we have a stake in any outcome. Our primary concern is protecting our users and their tokens.<br /><br />As we have done in the past when faced with similar circumstances (1), any decision we make will be with the security of users&#039; tokens in mind. We will be disabling deposits and withdrawals of Bitcoin (and all BTC related tokens) any time we deem necessary to ensure that all tokens stored on Poloniex remain safe. The length of any possible downtime is unknown as this is highly dependent on network stability. Our objective will be to bring the wallet back online and enable deposits and withdrawals as soon as we believe it is safe to do so. Trading will be unaffected during these periods.<br /><br />At this time, we cannot commit to supporting any specific blockchain that may emerge if there is a blockchain split. Even if two viable blockchains emerge, we may or may not support both and will make such a decision only after we are satisfied that we can safely support either blockchain in an enterprise environment. If we decide to support and make available derivative blockchain tokens after a blockchain split, note that if you have your tokens on loan at the time of a split, we cannot distribute the derivative tokens to you, the lender, as you would not possess them. Such loaned tokens can, and often do, leave the platform. (2)<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to leave the decision of which Bitcoin tokens to support (or recognize as valid) to a 3rd party, you should not keep your tokens on any 3rd party platform. We encourage you to follow our Twitter and Notices board for updates.<br /><br />- The Poloniex Team</div>

It is not out of the realm of possibility that some short sighted people may dump early on. What differentiates TOM to me, is the fact that is has something it is backed by- Wells on proven oil fields.<br /><br />Hope to see you soon!</div>

Your goal is interesting, but what if the price after ICO falls? Will this minimum amount be maintained? I&#039;ll read more about this project later, good luck.<br /></div><br />Is true, we moved fast, and because of that we will host the ICO longer than most since word of mouth is definitely needed with any project, already working on the new White Paper, but I&#039;ll take the time to answer your question.<br /><br />Excerpt from White Paper<br /><br /><i>Only $500,000 USD will get the company needed funds to commence drilling on two wells, sufficient to generate enough profits and <br />allow the company to open more wells for production.<br /><br />Obviously, if only $500,000 is raised less shareholder will have their hands in Tomahawk Exploration LLC, that&#039;s not to say that we are not allowed to have the ICO opened until we reach a decent goal, but nevertheless, more equity owners less profits spread among the group.<br /><br />&nbsp;Tomahawk Exploration LLC can make money as low as $20 per bbl , so how can we sit by and let events out of our control dictate our business future. Oil demand is increasing World Wide with the 2,000,000 bbls a day surplus being narrowed every year by a combination of our peak being reached and with China and India continuing their growth. The world will always be full of strife and all we need to do is keep going.<br /><br />Thankfully the actual price per barrel is approaching $50 and shows no indication of dropping since the US oil reserves are at it&#039;s lowest ever, also recent announcement by Trump administration will implement and reinforce restrictions and reductions on importing oil from Venezuela due to recent political events disrupting Venezuela&#039;s progress based on a current Dictatorship, as referred to by Donald J. Trump.<br /><br />We also have received an offer from a prestigious Private Financial firm in New York as follows, if Tomahawkcoin ICO is able to raise a minimum of $1 Mil USD in cryptocurrency value, they will commit $10 Mil USD from their portfolio assuring Tomahawk Exploration LLC success.<br /><br />Due to aggreements between both parties, we are not allowed to disclose detailed information regarding the firm&#039;s name, but as soon as the goal in discussion is met, the company will make such agreements available for public view.<br /><br />So with all these factors in place the price per barrel is going to move higher, although not good news for consumers, but great news for investors.<br /><br />Tomahawk should recover net to our interest approx. 80,000 bbls per well. If we use a low figure of $40 per bbl that nets us $3,200,000 per well if oil never goes above $40 per bbl. I predict low $50&#039;s in 2018. The Tomahawk wells will cost appox $500,000 each with oil flowing into the tanks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Using our finding cost of $500,000 and finding 80,000bbls shows we are finding oil for $6.25 per bbl. Producing oil at $6.25 and selling for at least $40 should give us a very healthy profit. I really believe that with a future Steamflood we should get at least 200,000 net bbls per well for a profit of $80,000,000 at $40bbl. A Steamflood would inject steam into the formation and flush a lot more oil out (Up to 300bopd).<br /><br />I hope this can clarify Tomahawks position on these matters. Remember, oil and it&#039;s derivatives (gasoline, diesel, plastics, medicines, fertilizers, many chemicals, lubrications and countless others) will be needed long after our lifetime. We appreciate your interest in Tomahawkcoin and our future. Hopefully together.<br /><br />So, what are the projected revenues after drilling? <br />The Company expects more than $500,000 USD to be generated by each well per year based on the reserve reports:<br />10 wells x $500,000 = $5,000,000 a year revenue projection<br /><br />Our initial plan was to transition from an already Private company to a Public traded one.<br /><br />But amidst recent news regarding the SEC targeting recently announced ICO&#039;s, we decided to best avoid them by staying Private, thus equity owned by our investors would not be subjected to SEC rules and regulations and only state regulations.<br /><br />The company will also implement a Coin Buy Back program in the future from these exchanges, which remains to be determined based on revenues and profits generated by the company<br /><br />The business plan provided by the Company is believed to increase the demand for Tomahawkcoin on digital currency exchange markets, such as Bittrex, Poloniex, and others, since ownership equals equity share equivalency, more coins, more voting power and company stake ownership<br /></i><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

This is a new way of making other people interested and involved. It makes the project not only famous, but also reliable.
