For a miner to successfully record the blocks, they have to have the transactions and block header all work out to have a hash less than a certain number. So the beginning will always have a bunch of zeros because the hash has to work out less than a certain target.<br /><br />See the article on difficulty (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) for more details.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The SHA256 &quot;solution&quot; hash for a block requires x number of zeros at the start as the way of controlling the &quot;difficulty&quot; to find such a hash by continually trying to hash the block header with a different &quot;nonce&quot; until such a solution is found.<br /><br />This is the &quot;proof of work&quot; that is fundamental to the Bitcoin block chain method to prevent double spends.<br /></div>

I suspect that some outputs r met more often than others.<br /></div><br />No hashing algorithm is perfectly distributed. &nbsp;That goal isn&#039;t even realistic or attempted. &nbsp;The theoretical &quot;perfect&quot; hashing function would be a Random Oracle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle). &nbsp;All practical implementations fall short of this ideal. &nbsp;SHA256 has been studied extensively to ensure its distribution is (for lack of a better term) &quot;randomly distributed enough&quot; to make using any imperfections in distribution an ineffective attack vector.<br /><br /><br />Here is a paper on forcing a collision attack (a method of exploiting non-random distribution) on a round reduced version of SHA256.<br />http://eprint.iacr.org/2008/131.pdf<br /><br />By round reduced it means that this &quot;attack&quot; is only theoretical at best because it involves a shortened version of the SHA256 algorithm.&nbsp; In theory similar attacks could eventually be found on longer versions and possibly someday even the full length version.</div>
