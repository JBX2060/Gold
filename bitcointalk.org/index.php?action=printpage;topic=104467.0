					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">1. I have an old wallet saved (unencrypted) with a few coins on it. I took this off my old computer and just downloaded the bitcoin client again. Is there a guide to plugging those coins into my new client? I figure there is a guide around somewhere, but though I could ask.<br /><br />2. More pressing and difficult.. I used to use Bitcoin OTC way before you needed to do some sort of PGP Authentication to even join the channel. In general, I had problems using Win GPG or whatever it was called, so there are probably keys from a few attempts sitting around on my old computer. I need to figure out what I am looking for and how to join OTC again. What am I looking for and how do I do this?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can&#039;t even ;;guide because I need to recover my password to freenode first and ATM don&#039;t even see how to do that.<br /><br />I found some stuff on bitcoin OTC&#039;s website... now just to decipher it. Thanks for the offer but I need to figure this out to prove who I am to try to get a loan, so maybe not the best time to be asking me for BTC heh.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Freenode doesn&#039;t require a password. It provides NickServ, which does use passwords; you can Google for information about that. If you&#039;ve been away for a long time, freenode staff will drop the nick for you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looks like someone just recently got the nick dropped and probably tried to use it to scam, only used it for a day, so I will have to wait 8+ weeks to get it again hoping they don&#039;t log in.<br /><br />I am hoping that my Bitcoin OTC name can be tied to another IRC name... This whole thing sucks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks. What I really need to do is &quot;sign a PGP message&quot; with whatever key I used for OTC, more than be able to visit OTC, though that will be nice to get sorted out later.<br /><br />I remember fiddling with PGP and being frustrated, so that is why I never went back to OTC. I think I have several PGP keys setup, so is there some way to tell from my OTC listing which is the right one?<br /><br />http://pool.sks-keyservers.net:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;search=0x05EC22B9A0119189344EF3786FCB388C6281BDB0 (http://pool.sks-keyservers.net:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;search=0x05EC22B9A0119189344EF3786FCB388C6281BDB0)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks but somehow I don&#039;t have either of those .gpg files either. I&#039;m not sure why. I installed a fresh GPA and it is fairly intuitive, but it offers to store the first private key you make anywhere so maybe I stored that somewhere random and when I thought I was backing up everything important in the GnuPG folder I left that out. I use win7 and when I search *.gpg all I get is stuff from my new install.<br /><br />My old computer was kind of an intermediate Dell POS after I had a freak accident destroy a build I made. I put my old HDD along with the intermediate computer, but to do that I had to swap Sata/power cables with the DVD drive. When I built a new system I was short on (IDE?) power cables for my HD/SSD/BR and took some out of the old system. I bought a new one but then since I didn&#039;t really need it misplaced it and let it all slide. This is easy to put back from the new system if I have to,&nbsp; but the old-old HDD somehow also had the plastic around the SATA connector broken off, a metal prong bent and it took me a while to even get it back in place. I think this second HD is where the real GPG info must be, if at all, and hopefully I can get it if I just shutdown my new computer and power the old drive.<br /><br />It is kind of too late now though and I don&#039;t even care. I will definitely be more careful if I try to be involved with this crap again. Thanks to all for your patient help.</div>

It seems like I backed up the whole GnuPG folder but kept everything important somewhere else.
