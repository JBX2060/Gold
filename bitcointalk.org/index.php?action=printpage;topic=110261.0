					Title: <b>Maximum Length of Satoshi Client Transactions?</b><br />

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey guys,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Just been thinking about this for a bit but couldn&#039;t find an answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the 0.6.2 Beta &quot;Bitcoin-Qt&quot; client (I think it&#039;s just the normal Satoshi Client people mention) and had a question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the &quot;Transactions&quot; tab, I of course, can see all the way back to my first bitcents earned. &nbsp;Is there a limit on how many log entries will show up though to the client? &nbsp;If I perform 1,000 transactions, will it show them all? &nbsp;If I do 10,000, would they still all show up?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For recordkeeping and other purposes, I&#039;d like to keep track of things in the future and would rather not suddenly see the client prune my log data. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&#039;t imagine even 1,000 transactions (date, from/to addresses, amount, and tx details) taking up that much space.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the help.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Won&#039;t this make future transactions very inefficient? Correct me if I&#039;m wrong but isnt the whole transaction log for any given address used to sign and broadcast future transactions?</div>
