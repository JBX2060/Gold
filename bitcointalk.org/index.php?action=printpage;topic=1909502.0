					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i used to use this application back in 2015 but discontinued because i forgot the license code/email.<br /><br />but 1 thing for sure, the bot is working as described.<br />scraping proxies and sending them as a genuine viewer to the web target.<br />too bad at that time, the proxies isn&#039;t elite/anon and its not good for YT views.<br /><br />For the price of 29$ for lifetime license, i think its a good deal.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would have passed this thread this time around because i remember asking the OP about how to download this software and try/test it before buying but he said i should send an email to them, the process which i found to be time consuming.<br /><br />With your title <i>SEEKING REVIEWERS! </i>, i am ready to review this software since i have an interest in it but you need to send me the download link.<br /><br />The discount giving to members of this forum only covers the monthly package or the life time package also?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is my (short) review: <br /><br />I have received a discount code from OP which allow be to get the software for free.<br />I made an account, download the software (you may get a security warning when you try to download it, I got one on Chrome) and started the bot.<br />The bot has multiple modules which can be used: simple visits, Google search, iframe click, random click, Youtube, Youtube views, etc.<br />You can choose https or http proxy (I used https for my test)<br />I use it to send &quot;simple visits&quot; to one of my websites - https://Btc.srl (https://btc.srl/)<br />Here is what I received:<br /><br /><a href="https://s13.postimg.org/ox9chf5uf/visists.jpg">https://s13.postimg.org/ox9chf5uf/visists.jpg</a><br /><br /><br />You can see that the number of visitors has increased significantly over the past 2 days<br /><br />My conclusion: the software is worth 29$ (for a lifetime license).</div>

I made an account downloaded the software. My Antivirus did not pop up anything while using the software. <br /><br />Running the software- Pretty easy and straight forward. As mention above there are numerous modules you able to choose from. Examples as simple visits, Google search, iframe click, random click, Youtube, Youtube views. Each module has its own set of instruction that makes it pretty easy and straight forward to use. <br /><br />As superiorus Mentioned above the Program does work on simple visits to a web page which could be used to increase your alexia ranking.<br /><br />I have also tried the Youtube Views module. While using the Program I have found that using the program right out of the box is not the best option for receiving youtube views or hits. I ran the program for 5 hours and only receive 10 hits in total. Using the Program right out of the box. Here are the proofs to show the increase.<br />before starting http://prntscr.com/f75l7z (http://prntscr.com/f75l7z) After running 5 hours http://prntscr.com/f78i3z.<br /><br />I spoke with the owner and insured I was using the program correctly. He stated right out of the box if you are wanting this to used as a Youtube only type bot you will need to provide your own private and paid proxies. Youtube bans most open and free proxies not allowing you to use it straight out of the box. Since I wanted to review the program as is and not change the anything that the package came with. I choose not to add private proxies for testing but may later.<br /><br />So Pros and Cons<br /><br />Pros<br />Easy to use and instruction found in every module <br />Works great for increasing alexia ranking <br /><br />Cons <br />Out of the box only works on web pages<br />Need private proxies for some modules (added cost in some instances)<br /><br />So the real question is it worth 29 bucks for a lifetime membership. If you want something easy to use for website hits straight out of the box and If the support is included with all future updates, I would Yes buy it <br /><br />I will be testing this for an entire week or more (time dependent) to get a real feel for it and will update as I see needed. Let me know if you have any questions.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello. Can the bot be configured to use only free proxies from a specific country? <br /><br />Also can the bot be configured to search for a specific keyword on Google and then click on a specific position / website from the results page? If yes, do you need paid proxies for this to work ?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

You will have to create or edit a preexisting module to do that though. The modules are open to edit so I believe if you have some minimal knowledge about scripting, you can do that.<br />For Google, Youtube and othe high-level security sites I always suggest private proxies. Because free proxies tend to require a captcha completion and that makes things way harder. We could implement the DBC API, but I think that DBC credits will end up being more expensive for users than private proxies.<br /></div>

You will get your refund soon. Just to clarify, I am a seller of DiabolicLabs, not the owner. DiabolicLabs always offers refunds, if you have a BlackHatWorld account you can also check this thread: https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/diabolic-traffic-bot-endless-traffic-for-life.746277/ and you will see that refunds are being processed.<br />Before deciding to work for any software provider, I check whether they treat the customers well. And DiabolicLabs treats them well. Again, you will get your refund. I will message the owner about your issue.</div>

I think it is very risky. <br />First of all, Google analytics did not calculate this traffic at all. <br />I set up a very low traffic rate with a minimum of two minutes between two &quot;visits&quot; and after less than one hour link was banned. Using goo.gl link shortener to track this traffic.<br /><br /></div>Did you use public or private proxies?<br /></div><br />Use Public proxy. Selected: Anonymous and Elite<br /></div>For Google, Youtube and sites that are that big you have to use paid proxies. I would go for residential rotating proxies.<br />Public proxies can be used for subreddit visitors, shopify visitors, soundcloud plays etc.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Youtube blocks almost every free proxy. Some may work but to have reliable results you need residential rotating proxies. Blackhatworld has a few decent sellers of such proxies.</div>
