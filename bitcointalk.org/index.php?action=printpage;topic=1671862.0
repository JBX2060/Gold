					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A few days ago I had trouble sending all the Testnet coins from my phone to development machine. Today I send some back to the phone after re-installing the app, and they&#039;ve not turned up. The transaction also has 30 confirmations, however it was made about 10 minutes ago.<br /><br />Has the Testnet forked and left my phone on one fork, and my dev machine using the other?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nope, someone just turned on a lot of mining power onto testnet briefly. This tends to happen since the difficulty is so low. At one point I remember there being several blocks being mined every second.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Problem is the block that my transaction was first included in only contains one transaction, and it isn&#039;t mine.<br /><br />The check transaction function in my software (which has worked perfectly during 6+ months of development) shows block 1029856 as the block it was first included in, however BlockCypher disagrees, and so does my testnet Android wallet. I&#039;ll drag the txid from the database and post it up here in a few minutes.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Okay, something&#039;s gone a bit screwed up. I must have screwed up the block height code when I re-wrote the GUI, but the transaction still hasn&#039;t appeared on my phone, and re-syncing it hasn&#039;t helped either.<br /><br />Just as I&#039;m typing it appears, ah well, non-existant problem solved. It&#039;s been one of those days!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also have problems with testnet.&nbsp; Some transactions I sent a few days ago still show as unconfirmed in Mycelium even though they have 4800 confirmations on blockr.io.<br /><br />And then I have sent a Segwit transaction.&nbsp; I first sent it without fee and later resent it with 5000 Satoshi fee. That still hasn&#039;t been confirmed after almost 2000 blocks have past.&nbsp; It is not displayed on tbtc.blockr.io nor on test-insight.bitpay.com (and I can&#039;t push it to blockr.io, because their push interface can&#039;t parse witnesses). <br /><br />Or is something wrong with it?<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">&gt; bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 35aafd22054d15bcb4f2444de56989b18fd9765f3c33fbb8b89ff12092d611f6<br /><br />0100000000010100675e46bdcd69821fbdc43abea61c1ba081469b6e53e3f8007073bf96be9fb20100000000ffffffff01388be605000000001976a914d6dcdaddc4208548846583ef1162c199309d3dc488ac02473044022018d165ad5cc04701eb0d19149bd48451775cbd0abcdb93232b167058952061ed02200279f0e9764e7aa555a83a05b19ab600d76afc60995c31e3dd6f7e63bfcfbb2301210279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f8179800000000<br /></div></div>

The transaction doesn&#039;t exist. I&#039;ve actually been having issues with sending Bitcoin to paper wallets. One feature of my system is that it can print a paper wallet, then send Bitcoin to it. Sometimes it took weeks before scanning the WIF code gave a balance, others have never worked even though the transaction is there on the blockchain.</div>
