I&#039;ve got many codes of BiPolarBob (of multiple websites) and all were legit. In fact, none of them have been reducted. Therefore you&#039;re talking rubbish, but I don&#039;t think anyone here is taking you serious.<br /><br />- -<br /><br />If these codes are legit, (as you&#039;ve got receipts), I think you will be alright too.

I often see people suggesting to use Gyft for buying these cards. Some people also recommended Egifter (https://www.egifter.com/) to buy such giftcards. You might need to pay a bit more than you have to pay for such gift cards on this forum, but now you&#039;re sure these cards are legit. In the end, it might spare you some money (as you do not end up with a illegal gift card - and therefore your balance deducted). </div>

I&#039;ve received multiple giftcards for multiple sites (Steam, Amazon etc), and they were and are all legit. People should stop calling him a scammer, BiPolarBob gave already away more than $10.000s worth in giftcards only on this forum. People should accept that great people still exist :). <br /><br />- -<br /><br />However, it is good to warn people for illegal Amazon Gift Cards like this topic does. Remember: if something appears too good to be true, it often is. Especially the (very) new members on this forum are likely to offer illegal giftcard codes. I think you can still buy these cards of trusted members of this forum (as they are not likely to ruin their account for just a few bucks) - go look for some trusted members if you are looking to buy such giftcards or use proven websites such as Gyft and Egifter (as has been mentioned before). </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Amazon could have just flagged the cards for being high value and being placed on a new account<br /><br />That&#039;s why I am very interested to see if they unlock the account once you provide receipts. &nbsp;If you provide receipts and they do not accept them, then you know something is up &nbsp;..fake receipts possibly?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why to buy Amazon gift cards that are stolen? Some just manage to get these stolen gift cards to work while some don&#039;t. Only those who are selling genuine AGCs via websites like cardpool and here are genuine sellers else don&#039;t buy gift cards for 20-30% of the face value. Don&#039;t expect them to work then. <br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry but i sell agc on 30% off usually. Why? because i live in europa, and i receive amazon gift card (for .com) from my CPA network.<br />I&#039;m sure that some guys sell stolen gift card, but in my case my location sucks big time, and if i want to order something from amazon.com, i must deal with customs, pay 10% duty fee and 20% VAT.<br />Not to mention notarized letter and so on bullshit. And the fact that on 50$ amazon mini sound box, i paid additional 50$ for shipping.<br />Hope that i makes sense now, why some guys sell their amazon gift card on a good discount.</div>
