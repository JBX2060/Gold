I like how you make the connections from the 2 japanese authors. But honestly, this is not final proof of anything.

It is a very interesting angle on this whole <br /><br />mystery and I would like to know a bit more. We can see that you put a lot of effort into your research and it shows in your final product. So what <br /><br />happened to this student &nbsp;---&gt; Pawel Pszona? &nbsp;::) ....While we playing with this idea, we might just entertain the possibility and have some fun. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Holy crap!&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe Ralph Waldo Emerson is Satoshi Nakamoto!!&nbsp; It makes perfect sense though.&nbsp; Look - a line of his poem &quot;The over-soul&quot; which can be roughly translated as &quot;The block-chain&quot;: &quot;<i>We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles</i>.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;Also look at his poem &quot;Nature&quot;:<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;<i>A subtle chain of countless rings<br />&nbsp;The next unto the farthest brings;<br />&nbsp;The eye reads omens where it goes,<br />&nbsp;And speaks all languages the rose;<br />&nbsp;And, striving to be man, the worm<br />&nbsp;Mounts through all the spires of form.</i>&quot;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;and this from his &quot;Introductory lecture on the Times&quot;:<br /><br />&quot;<i>There is a perfect chain,  see it, or see it not,  of reforms emerging from the surrounding darkness, each cherishing some part of the general idea, and all must be seen, in order to do justice to any one. Seen in this their natural connection, they are sublime. The conscience of the Age demonstrates itself in this effort to raise the life of man by putting it in harmony with his idea of the Beautiful and the Just.</i>&quot;&nbsp; &lt;--- that IS bitcoin! He nailed it!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Excellent research!&nbsp; I think you might be onto something there.<br /></div>

This stage is executed by a bank only once for each coin value v = 2l&#8722;1 dollars.<br />1. The bank generates a chain of prime numbers p1, p2, . . . , pl+1 such that there exist<br />values &#957;i &lt; 2<br />k and pi+1 = &#957;ipi + 1 (i = 1, . . . , l), where k is a parameter.<br />Furthermore, the bank generates groups Gp1<br />, . . . , Gpl<br />such that Gpi<br />is a subgroup of<br />order pi of Z<br />&#8727;<br />pi+1<br />and Gpi =&lt; gpi &gt; (Gpi<br />is a cyclic group generated by gpi<br />).<br />Then the bank chooses elements h(1,0), h(1,1) &#8712; Gp1<br />, h(2,0), h(2,1) &#8712; Gp2<br />, . . ., h(l,0),<br />h(l,1) &#8712; Gpl<br />such that discrete logarithms between them and their respective groups<br />generators are unknown.<br />2. The bank creates an empty database for storing the history of deposited payments.<br />Each payments entry contains x-values and T -values for all leaves that are descendants<br />of a spent node and an additional value R (a pseudorandom number used in<br />the payment protocol  it will be discussed later).<br />The database should also enable efficient searching for x-values (e.g., it could be sorted<br />by x-values).<br />3. The bank sets up parameters for CL signatures (i.e., n = pq and a cyclic group G of<br />order n).<br />4. The bank chooses a group G of prime order p (p &gt; pl+1), and picks its generators<br />g, g &#8712; G.<br />Then the bank makes all generated values public.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You are missing an important point here.<br /><br />Satoshi mainly solved two important things<br /><br />1. No Trusted Third Party<br /><br />2. Solve Double Spending without a centralized third party.<br /><br />The papers discusses both these things.<br /><br />I quote Gavin from the fortune article.<br /><br />&quot;There was also a lot of talk back then about digital cash and whether there was a way to pay for things that doesnt require you to trust a government or central authority. They never quite figured that part out. So all the ideas were there, but until Satoshi Nakamoto had this brilliant idea of how to solve the trust problem, it never really took off.&quot;<br /><br />http://fortune.com/2015/01/22/qa-gavin-andresen-bitcoin-foundation/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is a good theory and I&#039;ve looked at at least one of those people - check my post history (I think its in one my BCT posts anyway). &nbsp;However, why is this theory better than any other (not saying its wrong, I do like this work)? &nbsp;<br /><br />This theory needs to account for some additional facts I think. &nbsp;For example, how does it explain this: <br /><br />https://cryptome.org/2013/11/bitcoin-pirate-nakamoto.pdf (you can find this document by searching Hacking Team&#039;s cache on wikileaks, along with some of their emails discussing the topic).<br /><br />and these:<br /><br />http://www.iamsatoshi.com/free-market-and-free-people/<br />http://www.iamsatoshi.com/blockchain-politics-peter-todd/<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

Had Satoshi Nakaomoto being a single person,how would he set up the entire genesis block himself?There are couple of facts mentioned which are too certain to be true while other&#039;s are just useless assumptions created to fill in the purpose.Anyhow the article doesn&#039;t totally convince me but certainly does make me wannna research more on the facts you have mentioned.</div>

Your articles are well constructed. I&#039;ll keep an eye to what you do.<br /><br />I&#039;m still not sure who Satoshi is and I&#039;m not sure anyone would find out but anyway. Keep searching. In my opinion it&#039;s a single individual. I would be surprised if Satoshi was a group of person.<br /><br />(The pokemon thing made me laugh :D)</div>

A pokemon fan does not have to be a kid, especially in a country like Japan. Adults watch anime all the time there, including pokemon.<br /><br />Also, satoshi never specifically asked not to be traced. He just disappeared and never replied any more. This can be due to many reasons, one being that he doens&#039;t want to be found, but he could also have died for instance (even though that is highly unlikely). <br /></div>Still I have to disagree: few adults would watch Pokemon even in Japan, as it&#039;s definitely aimed for kids and young teenagers. I have a bunch of Japanese friends in their twenties (being myself in my twenties) and they indeed occasionally read mangas and probably watch anime (still I have to insist on the &quot;occasionally&quot; because Japan is a country where you&#039;d easily get marginalized if you spend too much time on these), but I&#039;d be surprised that they&#039;d watch Pokemon. I can ask around if you want. I admit that I never did. But I&#039;m pretty sure of the answer I&#039;ll get: Pokemon is for kids (and ok, nostalgic adults too, every now and then).<br /><br />But I&#039;m not pretending to hold the truth regarding the origin of the name Satoshi. I&#039;m just going with my own assumption that if Satoshi is indeed a pseudonym, there&#039;s a possibility that it was chosen by a western pokemon fan born between 1985 and 1995. These are just my thoughts though. Don&#039;t sweat it: I have no evidence that what I&#039;m saying is true. You could say I&#039;m just talking out of my ass &nbsp;:D . Especially if the guy is really Japanese but Satoshi is still a pseudonym, then chances would become really super slim that it would be because of Pokemon&#039;s creator, since he&#039;d have a much more developed background regarding Japanese names.</div>

A pokemon fan does not have to be a kid, especially in a country like Japan. Adults watch anime all the time there, including pokemon.<br /><br />Also, satoshi never specifically asked not to be traced. He just disappeared and never replied any more. This can be due to many reasons, one being that he doens&#039;t want to be found, but he could also have died for instance (even though that is highly unlikely). <br /></div>Still I have to disagree: few adults would watch Pokemon even in Japan, as it&#039;s definitely aimed for kids and young teenagers. I have a bunch of Japanese friends in their twenties (being myself in my twenties) and they indeed occasionally read mangas and probably watch anime (still I have to insist on the &quot;occasionally&quot; because Japan is a country where you&#039;d easily get marginalized if you spend too much time on these), but I&#039;d be surprised that they&#039;d watch Pokemon. I can ask around if you want. I admit that I never did. But I&#039;m pretty sure of the answer I&#039;ll get: Pokemon is for kids (and ok, nostalgic adults too, every now and then).<br /><br />But I&#039;m not pretending to hold the truth regarding the origin of the name Satoshi. I&#039;m just going with my own assumption that if Satoshi is indeed a pseudonym, there&#039;s a possibility that it was chosen by a western pokemon fan born between 1985 and 1995. These are just my thoughts though. Don&#039;t sweat it: I have no evidence that what I&#039;m saying is true. You could say I&#039;m just talking out of my ass &nbsp;:D . Especially if the guy is really Japanese but Satoshi is still a pseudonym, then chances would become really super slim that it would be because of Pokemon&#039;s creator, since he&#039;d have a much more developed background regarding Japanese names.<br /></div><br />The Media Create group did a study on the demographics of Pokemon X &amp; Y players, and they found a majority of them are college kids ages 19-24. This news bucks the claims that Nintendos games are only for kids. (http://playeressence.com/japanese-study-shows-majority-pokemon-x-y-players-college-kids/)<br /><br />Full Disclosure: I found this neat tool called Google. In the search function thingy I plugged in &quot;Pokémon demographics&quot; sans quote thingies.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br /><br />There&#039;s no reason satoshi has to be a group of people.&nbsp; <br /><br />We know about Wei Dai, Nick Szabo, Adam Back, Hal Finney, and all the people who contributed to cryptography, public key cryptography, hashing algorithms - all of these people contributed to the ideas behind Bitcoin.&nbsp; Even the guy who created Bittorrent helped pave the way for P2P networking.&nbsp; There are countless people whose work made Bitcoin possible.<br /><br />But none of those people kept their identities secret.&nbsp; Why would they suddenly all agree to start making their work anonymous?<br /><br />It&#039;s possible that satoshi put together their work into something new, without their direct involvement.&nbsp; And based on the small number of people mining after launch, it couldn&#039;t have been a very large group of people.&nbsp; There definitely weren&#039;t a large number of computers involved, which means it was probably just a few normal people with regular cheap computers and not a lot of money, resources, or connections to help get this project going.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hal Finney was probably the closest thing satoshi had to a partner, and his role was mostly limited to testing the first transaction.&nbsp; He only mined a few blocks.&nbsp; So if satoshi&#039;s choice for the first transaction recipient wouldn&#039;t even run a computer to help maintain the network, then where was this supposed group of people working together?<br /><br />If you think it would take lots of people to help refine the code, then you are correct.&nbsp; Lots of people from Bitcointalk have been contributing code for years.&nbsp; Bitcoin was far from a finished product when satoshi released it, and it&#039;s still not finished.&nbsp; So if it was designed by an elite group of geniuses, why have they needed so much constant outside help?&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s no proof either way;&nbsp; some people think the evidence suggests a group of people, but the evidence can also point to a single person.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Very valid points.<br /><br />1. It doesn&#039;t need a group to come up with an algorithm that is unique and never done before<br /><br />2. Every concept was already available. All Satoshi has to do is join them together. (hashcash, p2p, merkle, timestamp)<br /><br />3. It doesn&#039;t need a group to mine genesis block, few PC&#039;s and resources would do.<br /><br />4. If it was a group, for the kind of fame &quot;Satoshi&quot; have got today and with the kind of money involved, Someone in the group would come up by now to claim it for sure.<br /><br />It was always a SINGLE person IMHO.<br /></div>

Pawel either corrected the doc upon subsequent reads or another party making up Team Satoshi Nakamoto helped in cleaning up the prose while still maintaining the spirit of the original white paper. Some time between the two revisions, the term Bitcoin was coin with its domain name registered prior to the official release of the newly titled white paper.<br /><br />Sadly, we don&#039;t have access to the complete original to see what else was &#039;doctored&#039; (not nefariously), thus, perhaps, cementing or dismissing the notice.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Interesting. Your URL has just been flagged on Hacker News when Mike Hearn himself (!) explained why Bitcoin took off: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11008126 (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11008126) (archive: http://archive.is/BDaCM (http://archive.is/BDaCM)).<br /><br />Mike Hearn:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The quality of these &quot;unmaskings&quot; has been getting lower over time.<br /><br />The paper he cites from 2007 describes a system nothing like Bitcoin. Digital cash papers have been coming out every year for decades, it&#039;s always been a hot topic of research in the field of cryptography, since the days of Chaum. You could pick almost any time in any year and find some e-cash paper like that one.<br /><br />The attempt to link the Satoshi Nakamoto name with random fragments of random authors in random citations of an essentially randomly chosen paper is ... especially entertaining.<br /><br />The reasons Bitcoin took off despite a billion other crypto papers that also tried to crack the problem of digital cash are:<br /><br /> Bitcoin was simple enough for non-cryptographers to understand: no advanced maths, almost certainly because Satoshi himself was not a professional or academically trained cryptographer.<br /><br /> The unique monetary policy and coin distribution scheme that incentivised people to take part early on, and engaged people who weren&#039;t technologists but cared about monetary policy.<br /><br /> Most importantly of all, Satoshi actually implemented his scheme in a downloadable app that was fairly easy to use. So people could try it out and get excited about it.<br /><br /> Actually, truly P2P. Many e-cash schemes descended from Chaum&#039;s (and the 2007 paper is no different) assume a &quot;central bank&quot;. Bitcoin was one of the only schemes that had literally no special nodes.</div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">According to the latest report Trumph administration was concerned that Satoshi was an agent of Russia or China&#8202;&#8202;that Bitcoin might be weaponized against us in the future. Knowing the source would help the administration understand their motives. However, detailed research doesn&#039;t really prove anything..it&#039;s a directionless and never-ending debate. I don&#039;t understand why people are after his identity instead of enjoying the power of bitcoin. It&#039;s pointless. As far as I can tell Satoshi hasnt violated any laws and I have no idea if the NSA determined he was an agent of Russia or China or just a Japanese crypto hacker.</div>

Well I found the topic of this post more hypothetical as no one knows who is SATOSHI NAKAMOTO and no one saw him , he only use to communicate with people through many social networking sites and moreover people dont know that he is real or not and after all this you are saying that you found Satoshi Nakamoto then obviously no one is going to believe you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Satoshi Nakamoto still hiding in somewhere and we don&#039;t know where he lives. with so many news about Satoshi Nakamoto, I think he only laughs and smiles about this. I am not sure that he will reveal who is he and I think he will stay in the dark without telling to anybody about himself. it is better for him to still hiding so he can watch his bitcoin will reach his dreams and in the right time, he will reveal his self and will come out to the public and give explaining about the cryptocurrency.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In my opinion, I&nbsp; think Satoshi Nakamoto is already dead? Because if he knew bitcoin is a big time and famous now he would potentially go to public his achievements. Damn bitcoin is the one of the most influential and awesome that has been invented by humankind. And its FREE!!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So what ? I think if you found Satoshi that would not change anything! If Satoshi N. is an individual I would like to thank him for what he has given us and then move on with my life! However, I think Satoshi N. is not an individual but a group of people. Note that its my opinion only. To be honest it is not worth looking for who is Satoshi N, it is far more important to look into what we can do with what he has given us! </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just admit it. It is one of those secrets which may never be uncovered. I was really curious about the real identity of Satoshi, when I first started collecting crypto (six years ago). Gradually I realized that we may never uncover his real identity and we just need to admit it. </div>

Saying that someone found satoshi is just a speculations. Many people claimed that they&#039;re satoshi and they&#039;ve found satoshi, but they cant present reliable source.
