					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">dutchmailer is legit and was established in 2012. <br />It processes hundreds of parcels a month for Adidas NL and hundreds of other companies and individuals in over 60 countries. You will not find many reviews as most of our customers use our service anonymously for various reasons.<br /><br />Dutchmailer is a C.O.C. registered dutch company and has 5 business addreses one office address 4 staff members and caters to a niche market. Customer service is available per mail, email and whatsapp for time sensitive matters. <br />We are not a global mailing company and we do not process &quot;in 24 hours&quot; but specialize in personal shopper services, anonymous forwarding (for different very legitimate reasons), consolidation services and NL presence. <br />We are used by private parties as well as multi nationals. We ARE also used by dutch customers.<br /><br />We dont use twitter or social media. In fact we don&#039;t advertise at all - our customers come mouth to mouth.<br /><br />For adidas customers we have a special section (see website). If you have any questions or concerns you are free to contact us<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dont know guys.. <br />Usually companies don&#039;t find topics on the internet about them that quick maybe we have an insider?! :P<br />If your company processes for Adidas (who isn&#039;t anonymous) why isn&#039;t there any public record or reference to it?<br />Their website look like cheap HTML but that doesnt say that much, it has a SSL certificate. <br />Good look!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
