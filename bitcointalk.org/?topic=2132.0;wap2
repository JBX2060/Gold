			Anyone have any ideas for raising money for wikileaks? Some governments have frozens Julian Assange&#039;s bank accounts, paypal, and credit cards. I think Bitcoin would be a great way for them to get donations. Anyone think its a good idea? I would like to start accepting donations for wikileaks but I don&#039;t know who to contact at wikileaks about getting them to accept bitcoin donations.

			Satoshi is against it because Bitcoin is still in germinal stage.<br /><br />Too much bad press too early could destroy the project. <br /><br />Not that there a lack of solidarity towards Wikileaks in the Bitcoin community, but we need to help ourselves first before we can help others, or at least that&#039;s the idea.<br /><br />Of course Satoshi&#039;s word should not be taken as gospel, but majority of the community seems to agree with him/her right now.

			Don&#039;t do this as it would fix a bullseye on the Bitcoin community. We&#039;d be under intense heat and pressure.<br /><br />We need to quietly build our infrastructure and expand. Sure a government can&#039;t shut down the network itself, but they can close exchanges and that would devalue Bitcoins into nothing. There&#039;s lots of ways to attack the Bitcoin currency without touching the tech.

This community doesn&#039;t have to do anything about it. Let&#039;s just carry on.

			Wikileaks admins are aware of bitcoin, but according to them it&#039;s still in its infant stages (true) and &quot;too difficult to get dollars out again&quot;.<br /><br />Let&#039;s just wait, bitcoin will be good for the wikileaks of the future :)<br />
