					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am having a hell of a time getting my wallet to work again... It seems like it starts to download the blockchain and get&#039;s frozen.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have one address that is locked in to a couple pools I use and I do not want to lose it ...<br /><br /><br />Any help is much appreciated.. <br /><br /><br />Sorry still editing :) <br /><br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Importprivkey <br /><br />I got to this..... Can someone please give me an example of how to do this: I start a new wallet from scratch... I open bitcoind and use the command: importprivkey (what comes after this command) </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My reasoning behind this is that: when it get&#039;s near the end of downloading the blockchain it uses a ton of CPU and takes days to finish.... <br /><br /><br />I am confused...... I have the blockchain downloaded with the blk files... and blkindex but even after rescanning it starts downloading it from scratch....&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Another question.... Using any light client, can you export a key? or does that only work with the qt client?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Isn&#039;t there a dumpwallet or similar command?&nbsp; That&#039;d be the one you want.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found this: <br /><br />$ bitcoind help<br />[...]<br />&nbsp; importprivkey &lt;bitcoinprivkey&gt; [label]<br /><br /><br />BUT,, I have never used bitcoind and I tend to break stuff unless someone tells me what to do, I always seem to get different answers when googling certain topics.... <br /><br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><br /></div>

The wallet formats are different.&nbsp; You can import private keys into electrum I believe.<br /><br />Personally, I use Blockchain.info for my daily wallet as that is accessible via web and mobile app.&nbsp; It is a hybrid EWallet, doesn&#039;t have access to your private keys.<br /><br />But that too would require that you export your keys and transfer them.&nbsp; Letting the client complete the download is probably your safest point forward, then send a payment to empty your wallet rather than importing keys.</div>
