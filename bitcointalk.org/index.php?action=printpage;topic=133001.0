					Post by: <b>goldlyre</b> on <b>December 23, 2012, 04:54:28 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Needless to say, my offline Armory newly installed on a laptop is empty now and contains no money in it, but in the online Armory installed on my desktop (working together with the bitcoin-qt) there&#039;s some money because I&#039;ve just sent them into it from my another bitcoin wallet. <br /><br />Now I want to transfer the money in the online Armory to the offline laptop, (may need a USB flash stick again?) but the problem is that I don&#039;t know how to do it. (May be I&#039;m a damned fool!) <br /><br />Anybody can render me help? I need actual steps need to be done one by one. <br /><br />The first person having given useful tips here shall get 0.5 BTC as reward, but not until I can solve the problem of course - no cure, no pay. <br /><br />No kidding. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>To send your Bitcoins to your offline wallet</b>, it should have one or more Bitcoin addresses. Go to your online wallet, and send your Bitcoins to the offline wallet address.<br />The coins will be sent to the offline address, even if the offline wallet is never connected to the Internet.<br /><br /><b>If you just want to access your wallet on the offline computer </b>(not send coins to it), just put your wallet.dat onto a USB, and import it on the offline machine.<br /><br /><b>Tip me:</b> 1234568syWuTdAMp1Fxg3hroz2F1W5VvDS<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

This is a common misconception of newbies. <br /><br />Blockchain is a database of all bitcoin transactions in the history. Every computer running a full node (e.g. bitcoind, bitcoin-qt) has a copy of blockchain.<br /><br />If you want to check the account balance of your offline acounts, just go to blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com. Or you can use a watch-only wallet on an online computer.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this counts a &quot;solution&quot; because the question itself is faulty. Anyway, you may send some tips to 1CiZPrEJdN4FJcqdLdgVLzT8tgCXxT5ion if you find my answer useful</div>
