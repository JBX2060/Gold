					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just added a new feature on the site!<br /><br />There is a new button on the Withdrawal page to test send bitcoins.<br />What it will do is go through and selecting what coins to send just like when normally withdrawing bitcoins but instead of sending any it will return with an answer if there are enough coins in the mixer to send clean coins to you or not.<br /><br />If there aren&#039;t enough clean coins in the mixer when testing you can leave them in the wallet and let them mix with other users coins for a while. Depending on how much coins is going through the mixer at the time and how much you are trying to mix this can vary in time.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Decided to write a FAQ and a manual describing the features of this bitcoin mixer. Will keep this post updated<br /><br /><b>### Frequently asked questions ###<br /><br />How do I use Bitcoin Blender?</b><br />1. Register account.<br />2. Deposit coins to your deposit address.<br />3. Wait ~20-30 minutes for 3 confirms.<br />4. Go to Withdraw page.<br />5. Enter address, amount and click on &quot;Send bitcoins&quot;.<br />You will now receive other coins than you originally deposited, with no link to your old coins.<br /><br />If you want to stay a little more stealth you can spread your deposits to more addresses and then wait a day and then make your withdraws.<br /><br /><b>I sent coins to my deposit address but they never show up, where are they?</b><br />Take the address you sent the bitcoins to (hopefully your deposit address on Blender?) and go to https://blockchain.info and check the address there.<br />If they don&#039;t show there, you have not sent them. If you are not getting any confirmations this is probably because you did not include the miners fee when sending.<br /><br /><b>I withdrew coins from Bitcoin Blender but some are missing/they did not arrive, where are they?</b><br />Take the address you withdrew your coins to and go to https://blockchain.info and check the transactions.<br />If they show there then the problem is not on Bitcoin Blender. If you sent it to another web service it can take time for them to add the coins to your balance.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>### Depositing ###</b><br />After registering you get one deposit address, you can get up to a total of five addresses by clicking on the &quot;Get new deposit address&quot; button.<br /><br />After you have deposited coins to an address you can delete it by clicking on the grey X next to the address, you can then get another one again by clicking on &quot;Get new deposit address&quot;.<br /><br />When sending coins to any of your deposit addresses you will immediately see them as &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; on the site, after three confirms the coins will be added to your balance.<br />A random fee between 1 and 3% is taken upon time of deposit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>### Withdrawing ###</b><br />When navigating to the Withdraw page you will see a message at the top saying if there are enough coins in the mixer to be able to send you other coins than the ones you have deposited.<br />Bitcoin Blender keeps track of all your old deposited coins until they have completely left the mixer, this is to be able to do the above check and be sure to not ever send you the same coins.<br /><br />If the message says that there is not enough coins in the mixer you should use the Test Send function.<br /><br />1. Enter a lower amount of Bitcoins in the Amount field.<br />2. Click the Test Send button.<br />3. Read the status message.<br /><br />If it says that you can send it, then enter the address and amount again and click the &quot;Send bitcoins&quot; button.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>### Automatic Withdrawing ###</b><br />Another feature on Bitcoin Blender is Automatic Withdrawing.<br /><br />1. Enter a bitcoin address in the &quot;Activate Automatic Withdrawal to this address&quot; field<br />2. Click the &quot;Turn on automatic withdrawing&quot; button.<br />3. Deposit coins to your account<br />4. All coins on your account will be sent to the address specified<br /><br />From now on (until you turn it off) when you deposit coins to your account all your coins will automatically be sent to the address entered as the Automatic Withdawal address.<br />Automatic Withdrawal uses the Test Send function and will not withdraw any coins if there are not enough coins in the mixer to send you other coins than the ones you have deposited.<br />It will keep checking the mixer and as soon as there are enough to safely send you coins it will do it.<br /><br />If your coins are stuck at this place and you want to withdraw them anyways even though it will mean that you will get parts of your own coins back<br />you can turn off the Automatic Withdrawal feature by clicking on the &quot;Turn off automatic withdrawing&quot; button.<br />This will turn it off and at the same time it will send any pending transactions done by Automatic Withdrawal.<br /><br />After you have made your first withdrawals you will see a history of withdraws at the bottom of the page.<br />There is also a button to delete your transaction history, clicking on &quot;Delete transaction history&quot; will delete it from the database, but the log files are still there for a while.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>### Logs and Backup ###</b><br />Log files are deleted by a cronjob every night and it automatically deletes all logs older than 10 days: &quot;find /var/log/* -mtime +10 -delete&quot;<br /><br />Backup of database and wallet are taken every hour and put in a Truecrypt container and copied to another server with redundant disks.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>//Bitblender</i></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve used Bitcoin Blender about 6 times, and it&#039;s a fast, reliable, and trustworthy service! I ran a taint analysis on 2 of my transactions, and Bitcoin Blender successfully severed the link between my sending address and my destination address--so it does what it&#039;s supposed to do too! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;<br /><br />When blockchain.info did away with Shared Send, I was totally lost. There&#039;s always the fog, but the reviews have been very bad lately, and I cannot STAND to wait 3 days to tumble my coins. I&#039;m just <b>thrilled</b> to have found Bitcoin Blender!! I finally have an option that&#039;s totally safe, user friendly, trustworthy, and works in about 20 minutes. Thank you, blender, for creating such a great service!! &nbsp;8)<br /><br />Peace,<br />~Hippiechick<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello everyone,<br /><br />Just wanted to give a little feedback on a service I have been using continuously over the last 3 weeks: Bitcoinblender.<br /><br />I used to receive my coins in my electrum wallet on the pc from various sources, the withdraw it to whatever I withdraw it to :). Purely traceable if you checked block chain. I no longer receive bitcoins on my pc, I just use the blender wallet as the main receiving btc account. Here&#039;s some insight from my own blender account: You have deposited 2.84753152 BTC in the last 7 days.<br /><br />The service basically takes a random fee between 1% and 3% when you deposit and once it&#039;s confirmed what you see in your account is what you get when you withdraw.<br /><br />I have noticed that the owner of the site had been doing alot of improvements in terms of features since I have first used this service and I am glad I brought my contribution (in fees) to help the project get better. I feel like I have helped it. I have signed up here specifically to give some feedback on this service so don&#039;t mind if I am new here (not associated with blender in anyway, just as a user of the service), will no longer be posting again, I just want to tell everyone that it really works and it&#039;s a shame blender is not so popular.<br /><br />Receving &quot;dirty&quot; btc in a fixed wallet is just plain stupid. Get it to a mixer and withdraw other coins. Better safe than sorry. So everyone interested but still hesitating, give this a try. You are helping me as well: MORE COINS IN BLENDER, MORE COINS TO GET MIXED. Give this a try, as the creator said, start with low amounts at first if you feel uneasy.<br /><br />Good luck to anyone willing to try it! Please post feedback here once you start using it ..</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Its nice to see that there is finally some activity in this thread, but the circumstances are bad..<br /><br />Blender is up again and running on my backup bitcoins, unfortunately the backup coins does not cover everyones bitcoins.<br /><br />My solution is that I am not going to earn anything of the 1-3% commission so everything is going back to refund the users instead...<br /><br />This is the only way i can think of to be able to return all the bitcoins to the users, if i give up now and dont try to start Blender again there is no way i can come up with these coins... Then everyone loses!<br /><br />But as its now up and running, and users are actually trusting it already and using it again, if it continues like this then the fee everyone is paying is going to repay everyone eventually.<br /><br />To those who have returned, thanks for your trust and support! You are awesome! And remember the fee you are paying on deposits is not going to me, its going to everyone to pay everyone back, without you this will not work.<br /><br />Deposit and Withdraw transactions are going on the Blender right now, and as you can see that it works I hope to build everyones trust again.<br /><br />The hack did not involve doing SQL injections or other methods/exploits where he would get actual access to the server, it was simply that he sent a lot of withdraws really really fast and unfortunately i had not implemented SQL transactions to lock the database during withdraws. All he did was send many withdraws fast, so this means that he did not find anything, he did not get any logs, he did not get any usernames, he did not get access to the db. All information is still secret. I have implemented SQL transactions now, it locks the database during withdraws to prevent this from happening again. This together with other precautions have made me confident to launch the site again. If i had not found the bug, and successfully implemented the proper fix for it, then i would never start Blender again and put the backup coins online..<br /><br />I should have implemented this from the beginning, but i am taking the consequences and got the service running again to pay everyone back.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Bitblender</div>

If you were laundering large amounts maybe not<br /></div><br />Thanks for confirming this with an old account!<br /><br />This is the status, all new deposits made after the hack are available for withdraw immediately and will be successfully mixed without any delays or problems.<br /><br />Withdraws of old coins that was lost during the hack is throttled and will be sent out slowly as the fee of the new deposits is put into Blender to cover for these lost coins.<br /><br />This is an example if you have coins in Blender deposited before the hack.<br />Lets say you have 10 BTC in your balance since before the hack, if you now deposit 1 BTC you will be able to withdraw that without any delays what so ever.<br />But also, when you deposit coins into your own account, you will pay yourself back with 10% of the deposit. So if using the example above, it will enable you to withdraw 1.1 BTC without delays, meaning getting 0.1 BTC of those old coins back. This should encourage use of the mixer and at the same time you will be repaying yourself pretty fast.<br /><br /><br />I will repay everyone their lost coins, its just going to take some months..<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Bitblender</div>

The real site also offers two factor authentication using PGP for those who want, and the phishing site does of course not.<br /><br />The support function does not work on the phishing website, so that could be good to check too.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Bitblender</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would like to take a few moments to make you aware of a couple exciting developments coming to fruition on Bitcoin Blender this week.<br /><br />First, I am extremely happy to announce a feature tailored to our current and would-be users who want to mix coins without the need for an account. Bitcoin Blender now allows Quick Mix! It is simple to use: Navigate to the Quick Mix tab from our homepage (bitblendervrfkzr.onion) and enter one or more withdrawal addresses in the field provided. Then, complete the captcha challenge and select &quot;Create new Quick Mix.&quot; Finally, simply transfer the bitcoins you wish to mix to the forwarding address given on the next page. Remember, you should save your Quick Mix unique ID for the next time you use the mixer or in the unlikely event that you need to contact support regarding an individual mixing situation. The quick mix has a default randomized withdrawal delay of between zero and twelve hours. You may edit this setting of course, but I strongly urge you to allow a delay of up to twelve hours to achieve better anonymity. I have set the fee schedule of quick mix to match that of the normal mixer; that is, a randomized 1-3% to maximize transaction obfuscation.<br /><br />The second and most fulfilling development I bring to the forefront addresses an important issue for both myself and my userbase. As many of you may know, Blender was hacked back in mid-October (a race condition in our withdraw function was exploited, allowing the thief to create more withdrawals than he should have been able to.) Of course, I immediately took the service offline and determined the proper fix was to implement locking SQL transactions, and so I did this. <br /><br />Many coins were stolen in this attack, and since then all earnings from the use of the mixer have been diverted back into the pot to repay the coins. I am extremely proud, and humbled, to be able to say that as of today, all stolen coins are repaid and and all users who have attempted to withdraw their coins have been able to do so! Those users who still have balances remaining are free to withdraw their coin.<br /><br />I sincerely thank all of you who have continued to use the service and who see it as the best option available for mixing your bitcoins and improving your anonymity and ultimately safety - likewise I thank new and returning users for giving me the chance to prove my integrity. Bitcoin Blender is here for the long haul and its greatest feature and best asset is its users.<br /><br />Thank you.</div>

If you used Blender then message me via the support function that is built in on the site itself.<br /><br />It could be that you ended up on one of the phishing sites of one of the mixers available on Tor, knowing that the onion is the correct one for a service is a problem. In my attempts to try to stop the effects of phishing sites i have implemented a &quot;Proof of Ownership&quot; of the Deposit addresses, its a signed PGP message containing your username and deposit addresses, you generate it on the deposit page.<br />During withdraw there is a Verification step where you also get a signed PGP message with the destination addresses, here you can either choose to submit it or cancel the withdraw.<br />You can also enable 2FA on your account, it generates one time passwords that you have to decrypt using your PGP key on each login.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Coinbase have started tracking their users bitcoin transactions and if the coins end up on a known Darknet Market bitcoin address they close the Coinbase account, and i guess Coinbase might tell LE at the same time too.<br />https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2q90m9/coinbase_is_monitoring_your_transactions_poorly<br />https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2qa21d/coinbase_to_market_is_a_really_bad_idea_yall_post/<br /><br />If you are using Bitcoin Blender to mix coins to or from Darknet Markets you can now set your account type to either Buyer or Vendor on the Profile page. If you are not comfortable giving this information to Blender you can set it to N/A or not set it at all.<br /><br />If you set your account to Vendor you will receive mixed coins deposited by Buyers when withdrawing, this means that you should receive coins coming from exchanges like Coinbase, Circle and Localbitcoins or where Buyers get their coins from.<br /><br />If you set your account to Buyer you will receive mixed coins deposited by Vendors when withdrawing, your deposited coins to Blender should not end up on a Darknet Market.<br /><br />If you set your account to N/A or don&#039;t make a choice you will receive mixed coins deposited by other N/A users.<br /><br />This is good for both Buyers and Vendors. The Buyers can feel safe knowing the coins they deposit into Blender will not end up on a Darknet Market and the Vendors that withdraw from Blender will receive clean coins coming from Exchanges. This will keep the clean/Exchange coins on one side and the Darknet Market coins on the other side. This is not a 100% guarantee that coins will be sent exactly as described above as it will only work if the users chooses the right type for their Blender account or don&#039;t by purpose choose Vendor when they are actually a Buyer for example. At least having this option is better than not having it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">CoinCidental, thanks for starting a discussion about this.<br /><br />Im sure there is no law in any country against having coins that has taint with a DNM, just like you say its not illegal to have paper money that was used to do cocaine, it does not mean you did it. A very large percentage of all coins have gone through some exchanges main addresses/hot wallets so they are all tainted with each other, if you buy coins on an exchange you will almost certainly receive coins that has some taint to a DNM address far far away, eventually the recent Bitstamp hacked coins will be sent around like this too.<br /><br />Having a clear transaction from your Coinbase account to a known bitcoin address used for buying drugs can be a problem though as shown in that reddit thread. But if you mix your coins properly there is no way to trace that you actually did the transaction to the DNM, as the coins mix in the mixer while you receive other coins. I removed the feature of choosing if you are a DNM Vendor, Buyer or N/A. I did not think enough before releasing it and what I wrote here is the reason for me removing it again, its not needed as the link between your transactions are broken and Coinbase can not see where you are sending it.<br /><br />I&#039;m actively improving and changing stuff, if i release a feature that i later decide is not good enough or not needed then i will remove it to keep it as simple as possible while still providing a good mixing service. I don&#039;t think the feature of registering as a Vendor, Buyer or N/A was bad or made anything worse, it was just not needed. If there is some good discussion about this and the conclusion is that it is a good idea to keep the DNM Buyers and Vendors coins separate as described in my announcement above or in some other clever way then it will be brought back after some consideration.</div>

Now that&#039;s solved, but it placed a negative feeling on bitcoin fog for me as far as I am concerned..<br /><br />Just wanted to say that I am reputable seller on evo (for security reasons won&#039;t say my username here) and I have been washing my coins on blender so far, maybe more than 100 btc without any issues. I see that blender has been hacked last year, my luck I usually withdraw my coins fast, I don&#039;t let them sit in my account. Thumbs up to the owner of the site for refunding everyone.<br /><br />Again want to reconfirm to everyone, this is probably the best service around, I would also recommed bitcoin fog (though for me it&#039;s still in beta testing before I get 100% confidence) and probably still to be tested bitmixer.io, I&#039;ve read many positive reviews and I will definitelly try that at one point.<br /><br />My scheme for washing is bitcoin fog, then withdraw to blender and them to cash out wallet so it&#039;s double washing. I recommend washing your coins twice, by different mixing services, law enforcement may be behind washing services so you can&#039;t just trust one. I&#039;d rather be too paranoid than behind bars. Also never use the same user id on any of the washing services. I create new fog/blender accounts once every 2 or 3 days and delete the old ones after withdrawing my coins.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Im getting more and more support messages from users losing coins to phishing sites. There is a phishing site that is pretty high on google search results of bitcoin blender, its the third in the list. Its important to use the correct URL and it can be found on the first post on this thread.<br /><br />If anyone can help me getting the phishing site removed from search results or hosting provider or at least lower ranks on search results (anti seo) then i will pay you for helping, please contact me!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For a very long time i&#039;ve had a meta refresh with a html encoded link as a countermeasure against mitm phishing/Onion Cloner, it redirects the user over to the correct site as the browser decodes the character but Onion Cloner did not.<br /><br />Lately i have been getting more users visiting through mitm phishing proxys again, i investigated and found that it now rewrites html encoded characters to keep the browser on the wrong onion host, so the meta refresh redirect trick above does not work any more.<br /><br />I have written a very simple javascript that runs in the browser and checks if the correct host is used, the correct hostname is base64 encoded inside the javascript and so far this is not rewritten by the mitm proxy sites. The base64 encoded string is then decoded on browser side and if its not correct it will redirect over to the correct host.<br /><br />&lt;script&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if (window.location.host != atob(&quot;Yml0YmxlbmRlcnZyZmt6ci5vbmlvbg==&quot;)) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; window.location.host = atob(&quot;Yml0YmxlbmRlcnZyZmt6ci5vbmlvbg==&quot;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />I am not encouraging to activate JavaScript in browsers, but if the user has it activated i might as well use it for something good.</div>

Thankfully it wasn&#039;t a lot of coins but I never used their services again, BTC Blender on the other hand has always come through for me!

Before that I was using bitmixer. <br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I recently read some posts of some people where they are claiming for it to be a scam, I hope it will work correctly and will not scam, by the way I will keep my transactions lower and will see the future of it that where it go.</div>

Two-Factor Authentication with PGP key.<br />2. The captcha on the register page displays the correct URL to use.<br />3. Its possible to know that the deposit addresses displayed are correct by verifying that the Proof of Ownership PGP message is signed by my key, save the PGP message.</div>

everything<br />tested it out with a small transaction first<br />i put everything i could into this tumble since i&#039;m getting divorced and my wife is trying to take everything she can<br />the divorce lawyers are looking into everything, i thought that this would at least prevent them from taking everything<br />but i tumbled everything that i could scrape up, even from the couch cushions, in addition to what she was trying to take<br />now it&#039;s all gone, i can&#039;t find anything... &nbsp;as if i never even initiated the transaction...<br />i&#039;m totally done for...<br />i was already on the ledge of sanity to begin with, but this is it, i&#039;m done.....<br />totally wiped out... i have absolutely nothing left.....<br />this was literally my first entry into bitcoin, too...<br />i thought that it was perfect timing, would prevent my wife from stealing my drawers, but now i did it to myself...<br />i&#039;m so screwed<br />it&#039;s really all gone<br />i&#039;m

a better place<br />people who are more knowledgeable, tech-savvy, motivated, entrepreneurial<br />we need a big influx of those people to leapfrog the human race to the stars, because it&#039;s

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>New fee system on Bitcoin Blender, new minimum deposit amount and minimum withdraw amount.</b><br /><br />I have always had a minimum withdraw limit of 0.01 BTC but with the raise of bitcoins value this is almost 200 USD now, many users are requesting that i lower this restriction.<br /><br />I do not want a minimum amount, it is only there because the service fee (1-3%) I take must cover the bitcoin transaction fees i pay for mixing the coins and withdraws, if the user deposited amount is too low i lose bitcoins mixing them because the transaction fee costs are higher than what i earn in service fee.<br /><br />If i could i would not have minimum restrictions at all.<br /><br />When I checked https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/ a few days ago, a normal transaction (226 bytes) needed 0.001 BTC to be confirmed in the next block.<br /><br />If each withdraw made from Blender costs me 0.001 BTC to send I lose bitcoin on users who mix below 0.1 BTC if the randomized fee is 1%.<br /><br />The solution is not to raise the minimum withdraw to 0.1 BTC and turn away even more users. And i also do not want to shut down.<br /><br />So I have instead decided to add an extra fee per deposit made to Blender on top of the normal 1-3% randomized service fee.<br />This extra fee will be based on my bitcoin nodes current estimated fee of a 1 block confirmation time, it is the same fee estimation i use on sending withdraws.<br /><br />Unfortunately this creates a minimum amount for deposits which i did not previously have, for example if the current estimated transaction fee is 0.00098 BTC and you make a deposit with lower than that value you will receive 0 BTC in your balance for that deposit.<br /><br />If the deposited value is lower than the current fee to spend the coins they are worthless and I will not be able to help users which deposit values that is too low.<br /><br /><b>There are now two fees taken on new deposits.</b><br /><br /><b>Service fee:</b> Randomized between 1-3%<br /><b>Transaction fee:</b> currently this is around 0.00098 BTC, is based on the estimated fee of a 1 block confirmation time,&nbsp; and adjusts dynamically, this value will be displayed on the deposit page.<br /><br /><b>New minimum withdraw limit is lowered</b> from 0.01 BTC to 0.001 BTC.<br /><br /><br /><br />Best regards,<br />Bitblender</div>

I had registered on a different url site but when the link to DeepDotWeb stopped working today I became suspicious and found this thread with an alternative url. Although everything corresponds between Blender&#039;s comments and the site/url I have now signed up for, some extra reassurance would be great (recently got scammed by a fake tumbling service and can&#039;t afford to have that happen again!). Thanks in advance for any assistance! </div>

Remember the correct URL.<br /><br />Mixing slowly is the best way: Deposit 50 BTC spread out over your 5 deposit addresses, then create withdraws to maybe 8 addresses with randomized delays, 2-12 hours for example. Login again after 12 hours, remove your old deposit addresses and create new ones, deposit, create new withdraws. Repeat for a few months until you are done.<br /><br />You can read a guide here https://bitblender.io/guide.html it explains why using multiple destinations on withdraws, randomized fees on the mixer and randomized delays on withdraws are important.</div>

In the past it was complaint also in bitmixer and now when I searched for bitblender I also saw the scam phishing site at the google ad on the top of the search. So make it your habit to not click on any ad at the top of your search when you search for your product. Plus do not forget to report when you see anything scam or phishing on the google ads. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I just got back into bitcoins, and figured I&#039;d use Bitcoin Blender again, so the first site that DuckDuckGo comes up with in a search had this URL: http://bitblenduun5mnwp.onion/index&nbsp; which is apparently a scam site. They took $200 from me, at a time when we really couldn&#039;t afford to lose that. So far, there are at least 2 scam sites that I&#039;ve found.</div>

I&#039;m apprehensive about a few points and I&#039;d love for you to clarify for me and the rest of us who may be wondering.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.msg5824230#msg5824230">Quote from: blender on March 21, 2014, 04:24:41 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><b>### Logs and Backup ###</b><br />Log files are deleted by a cronjob every night and it automatically deletes all logs older than 10 days: &quot;find /var/log/* -mtime +10 -delete&quot;<br /><br />Backup of database and wallet are taken every hour and put in a Truecrypt container and copied to another server with redundant disks.<br /></div><br />The purpose of a tumbler is privacy and anonymity.

Several statements are made on your website that are not clear and need additional clarification.

I understand that the tumbler is ready, but I don&#039;t understand what you mean to imply by stating that if the user is to withdrawal the &#039;entire&#039; and &#039;full&#039; amount at one time, the user will receive new coins. This is how I have interpreted this message and it&#039;s left me flabbergasted. <br /><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>What are &#039;new coins&#039; in this context?</li><li>Is receiving these &#039;new coins&#039; solely dependent on withdrawing the entire amount at one time?</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Under the same tab, but further down below &#039;Automatic Withdrawal&#039;:</b><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Automatic Withdraw runs four times per day and will at these times take your accounts balance and create withdraws spread across your specified addresses with random delays and amounts.<br /></div><br />Are these &#039;four times per day&#039; at the exact same time each and every day, or are these four times randomised between days?

If so, to what degree?</li><li>Is the &#039;Quick Mix ID&#039; used only for tracking the tumble function while in-progress and immediately after for support?</li></ul><br />And finally just one more question. If a user were to create a single account and use your service over the course of a single year, making 100 deposits and 50 tumble operations to various wallet addresses, how can the user be sure that they will never have the unfortunate issue of receiving one of their previously entered coins from months earlier?<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that the user deposited Coin A in January, Coin B in February, requested a withdrawal for the total value of Coin A and Coin B and receiving this withdrawal and now have an account balance of 0.0 BTC and then later Coins C and D are deposited in August and a subsequent withdrawal is made resulting in a part of the earlier Coin A being tumbled into the mix with Coins C and D.<br /><br />Have you protected against this?<br /><br />I am looking forward to viewing a substantial addressing of these points as I believe I&#039;m not the only one curious. Thank you for the wonderful service and continued support.</div>

In case the original server hardware fails I can quickly change over to the backup server as its always ready. Both are bare metal and are installed by me (Not Windows) and uses full disk encryption. Old backups are of course also removed.<br /><br />Old log files are removed. In the database old withdraws, deposits, deposit addresses, support messages, quickmixes, login attempts are removed.

That message explains that you can either wait for the mixer to catch up so you can withdraw or wait for me to move in coins from cold storage, and recommends the user to contact me through support.<br /><br />I will change the message as it is misleading, of course you can withdraw less than your whole balance.<br /><br />Deposited coins are sent and mixed in different ways on the way to the withdraw wallet and thats where withdraws are sent from.

The problem with the automatic withdraw feature is that users set their addresses there once and then don&#039;t seem to change them often, so it encourages address re-use which is bad for anonymity.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.msg47441347#msg47441347">Quote from: TheClarifier on October 31, 2018, 03:10:33 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><b><br />While NOT logged in and under the &#039;QUICK MIX&#039; tab:</b><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">If you have a Quick Mix ID from previous mixes enter it here, or if you want to check the status of a Quick Mix in progress enter it and use the button on the bottom of the page.<br /></div><br />I scoured this entire thread and all the documentation available on your website, and no where is the function of the &#039;Quick Mix ID&#039; explained anywhere.<br /><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>How does the &#039;Quick Mix ID&#039; function?

So if you come back later and you enter the same quickmix id it wont send you any of your old coins on withdraw.

If a user were to create a single account and use your service over the course of a single year, making 100 deposits and 50 tumble operations to various wallet addresses, how can the user be sure that they will never have the unfortunate issue of receiving one of their previously entered coins from months earlier?<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that the user deposited Coin A in January, Coin B in February, requested a withdrawal for the total value of Coin A and Coin B and receiving this withdrawal and now have an account balance of 0.0 BTC and then later Coins C and D are deposited in August and a subsequent withdrawal is made resulting in a part of the earlier Coin A being tumbled into the mix with Coins C and D.<br /><br />Have you protected against this?<br /></div><br />As long as a part of your coins are still in the mixer wallet I keep track of them, each UTXO is marked as belonging to a specific user or several users. Usually coins are only in the mixer for a few days so its not a big issue to keep track of them. That will prevent your example above from happening, if I understood you correct?<br /><br />But there are other interesting things that can happen. Hope I can explain this so it makes sense with this example..<br />User A deposits 100 BTC to Address 1A. Some part of the coins deposited on 1A is eventually sent out of the mixer to another bitcoin service by some random Blender user.<br />User B also have an account on the same bitcoin service and decides to withdraw his coins to Bitcoin Blender and receives parts of the same coins the other user deposited on that service. Now there are coins in the mixer which has taint to Address 1A but is deposited by User B... The coins once deposited on Address 1A could of course be sent between several different bitcoin services before ending up on Bitcoin Blender again, but there could still be some small taint % to Address 1A there.<br /><br />Thats why I have built my own taint analysis tool into the mixer, it is similar to the one blockchain.info used to have.<br /><br />So on withdraw the mixer checks that the UTXO it is about to spend does not belong to you, and it also checks the taint on that UTXO. It checks that any of your deposit addresses is not in the taint report of that UTXO. Once you remove a deposit address it is kept for 7 days before the link to the user is completely removed, after that this taint check wont work for that address.</div>

They would then not be able to follow those coins to find out where you withdrew it, they would need to go check all bitcoin transactions and see if they find a transaction of 97-99 BTC in a block after the transaction. 97-99 is within the 1-3% service fee i take. Every hour there are approximately 10-15 000 transactions, some of them are between 97-99 BTC, after a day there should have been enough transactions on the bitcoin blockchain within that range that they cant know which one is yours or if you even withdrew yet or not. To make it harder for them to guess which transaction would be your withdraw its a good idea to withdraw to maybe 2 addresses and with randomized amounts and long randomized delays.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.msg47526583#msg47526583">Quote from: TheClarifier on November 02, 2018, 06:34:24 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Can you tell us a little bit about what sort of cryptographic solution you use to track every sincle coin and fraction of a coin that a user has originally owned so they will never receive it again?<br /></div>No<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.msg47526583#msg47526583">Quote from: TheClarifier on November 02, 2018, 06:34:24 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Can you tell us some statistics about what the maximum length of time a single coin, or fraction of a coin, has remained on the tumbler before finally being tumbled out?<br /></div>No I wont tell you, but it depends on the amount of coins in the mixer wallets and the volume users make.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I recently came to know about the shutting down process of bitblender, I had much coins saved onto it. I unfortunately missed the withdrawal warning as I was away for past few weeks. I am trying to access http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/ for last 2~3 hours but I can not succeed.<br /><br />Anyone can help me get in touch with the owners/admin of them so that I can request a withdrawal, I can prove my account ownership with the help of PGP signature of addresses, username/password, etc.<br /><br />Please, I request all of you here. It was all my savings. <br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had checked while it was up and didn&#039;t realize they had a message about shutting down. Grabbed my deposit address and had some coins sent there. A lot of my money is tied up in BB and I plead with the operators to turn it back on with ample warning of when that will be and when it will be shut off again. When I checked BB two days ago, I figured the reason I wasn&#039;t able to reach it was because of Tor acting up. News like this travels slowly, and I hope the BB team will do the right thing by allowing their faithful users to withdraw their funds. I would not consider the current situation to have been fair, and as others mention, is likened to an exit scam. From what I gather, though, the BB has shown that is not what they&#039;re about. Knock on wood.<br /><br />I&#039;ll continue checking back here. Blender, if you send me a PM asking for the deposit address, I will happily oblige. These losses are devastating for me and many others. In fact, I will commit to donating $50 to BB if I am ever able to recover those coins.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />EDIT: I just stupidly locked myself out this account. Will create another account with user foreignone82 that I&#039;ll be able to log in with from here on out.</div>

I admit there is no way to avoid the danger of logs or other instruments of sharing the secrets of the mixing process also if you use other mixers like bitblender. you have to trust the mixer in any way. therefore again, time of mixers had come to an end.</div>

It is too soon to judge everything with BitBlender. I agreed that BitBlender reacted and communicated badly with their users this time (very short announcement, and did not state how long withdrawals will be opened for their users before the site totally shut down). However, I have a vague feeling that (maybe) the BitBlender was just over panicly with the shit happened with Best Mixer, and reacted this way. Let&#039;s see what&#039;s next weeks. I hope that when things cooled down, they might communicate more transparently and allow their users more time to withdraw funds.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Shouldn&#039;t people just start using GRIN instead and be done with the mixing services?<br />I suppose it&#039;s not as helpful as mixing services because there are cases when you just want to send BTC and nothing else, but overall GRIN has many advantages,<br />A) You don&#039;t need to trust a 3rd party (the mixing service) to send anonymously.<br />B) It&#039;s even more anonymous than mixing services since you can transact without even having a public address, but instead by exchanging a transaction file with the other party <b>*</b>.<br />C) There are no fees to be pay in a 3rd party and even the network fees are very low.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><i><b>*I don&#039;t 100% understand how this works, so I might have said something wrong in point B. If anyone cares, you can try understand it more deeply by reading here: https://medium.com/@brandonarvanaghi/grin-transactions-explained-step-by-step-fdceb905a853</b></i></span><br /><br />I guess it&#039;s still a bit too complicated to use GRIN, but hopefully this will change soon in order to provide people who want anonymity so badly with a great alternative to mixing.</div>

It seems that he has good agenda so guess that he will open the website at least one more with longer notice or send out coins because there will be a shitstorm to follow if he wipe servers and keeping the coins himself.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Follow your bitblender deposit addresses specified in the signed letter you saved on tails persistent storage. Or look in the wallet you sent coins from.&nbsp; The coins sent to my bitblender input address were moved to an address with over 100 inputs totalling almost 11 BTC, all unspent. <br /><br />An earlier bitblender deposit was combined with about 100 inputs totalling around 10 BTC and sent to many addresses in a bunch of steps, with the unspent change of 2.99993936 BTC ending up in 3Qth9HPoeMjbVx3BZY1Drb8RxsbZuFj4vf at 2019-05-28 20:20. Watch that address to see if it gets spent. I&#039;m sure LE is watching it; they know it the same way I know it. I expect it will never be spent.<br /><br />If I were operating bitblender and knew LE was coming soon, I&#039;d wipe the servers erasing everything including the BTC private keys. Of course LE has been sending coins through bitblender so they know the addresses where all the incoming deposits were aggregated. So if they catch you with those keys, they can prove you are the operator. Or if they catch you with the secret Tor uses to identify bitblendervrfkzr. So I expect the operator no longer knows those secrets, and hence can&#039;t bring bitblendervrfkzr back up and can&#039;t send your coins anywhere. If so, the coins have been destroyed.<br /><br /></div>

If the funds were kept in a LE-&quot;unsecure environment&quot; he could, as you suggested, move all the coins to a new adress he generated somewhere safely/offline, then destroy/remove the server in which the &quot;unsecure&quot; keys and adresses were stored, and still keep the funds.<br /><br />Then he could either mix those funds using coinjoin, wasabi, monero, chipmixer, or simply wait until a provably-fair &quot;privacy&quot;-provider mixer comes into the market.<br /><br /></div>

I understand his position though there is no reason to not move the service to another .onion and allow people much more time. Possibly give someone here a way to contact that Blender trusts?

Apparently, a few months ago he was paranoid about BestMixer and was deciding whether to shut down. Obviously, he waited it out and gave way too little notice knowing he would be able to exit scam any remaining coins. There is someone here that has knowledge of him and most likely a way to correspond.</div>

I used Blender for years, he was hacked, replace everyone&#039;s coins, he definitely seemed to be honest about the service. Regardless, three days is too short to shutdown a service like this and from speaking to multiple people he was paranoid when Bestmixer was in trouble. He destroyed the server though on June 13th he moved all remaining coin to two seperate addresses. It stinks and he is an asshole for not giving people more time and exit scamming.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It looks like I am a bit late to the party but I havent used crypto in a while and went to withdraw it and saw the notice you posted about closing the site. I wasnt able to withdraw in time since I just saw the notice and was wondering if I could still recover my BTC if I provided the account details for the account.<br /><br /></div>

They just closed their services 2 days after announcing it and left a lot of people without their coins. They haven’t come back or answered anyone since them.</div>
