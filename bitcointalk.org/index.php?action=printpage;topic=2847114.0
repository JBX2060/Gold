					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Pretty good review by CryptoRated here: https://cryptorated.com/ico-rating/ceek/<br /><br />I think it&#039;s good that the token is pegged against USD, instead of BTC or ETH. There were projects that made the mistake of being pegged against a volatile value.<br />Just a question, what makes this project better than Decentraland?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Too greedy with hard cap of 50m (compared to vibe which is considered a successful VR ICO at 80m cap at the moment).<br /><br />No lock-in shows lack of faith and website does not look up to standard....<br /><br />Big partnerships but they aren&#039;t explained although headsets seem are sold at large retailers.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bitcoin Garden: Blockchain and VR Implementation to Sustain and Expanding Showbiz Industry<br />https://bitcoingarden.org/blockchain-vr-implementation-sustain-expanding-showbiz-industry/<br /><br /><i>The sponsorship deal between 10,000m long-track speed skating at the PyeongChang Olympics, Canadian Ted-Jan Bloemen and CEEK VR further emphasizes the platforms arrival into the mainstream of human social interaction.<br /><br />CEEK is a platform that is designed to eliminate the limitations that currently exist in the showbiz industry, where artists are not able to maximize the potential of their products. This happens because of the fact that space and geographical restriction are taking their toll on the industry’s expansion.<br /><br />Each year 60 million concert tickets are sold in the USA alone. The demand for iconic music artists to perform at live events far outweigh their capacity leaving them with missed revenue opportunities and fans without the chance to experience live shows. Therefore, the adoption of VR technology which enables fans and followers enjoy the same ambience and feel of being present in event arenas is helping solve the issue of satisfaction and revenue generation as well....</i><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The fact that the project is developing the virtual reality industry is very interesting. But, I&#039;m interested in the manufacturability of the coin itself. The security of the wallet, anonymity, speed and price of transactions. How much X can I earn if I buy your tokens?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">CEEK Offers a Breathtaking Solution Combining VR and Live Music<br /><br />For years now, two entertainment genres have been developing alongside each other - exponentially but separately. They serve disparate populations and offer different user experiences. And while some lucky folks do appreciate and actively participate in both worlds, others reject one or the other, or possibly even fail to recognize the other’s valid presence in entertainment. These two worlds are Virtual Reality (VR) and live music. VR platform CEEK has developed a way to not only merge them, but also to revolutionize the way we watch live music.<br /><br />Read the details in the article of Coinidol dot com, the world blockchain news outlet: https://coinidol.com/ceek-offers-breathtaking-solution/<br /><br /><a href="https://coinidol.com/upload/resize_cache/iblock/caf/900_900_1/caf632192d8cc96bded6c0da98d80e50.jpg">https://coinidol.com/upload/resize_cache/iblock/caf/900_900_1/caf632192d8cc96bded6c0da98d80e50.jpg</a></div>

Basic idea is to make it simple on boarding process for the people who are less skilled and find MEW to complicated, but still want to have easy access to crypto. For example, by having this wallet on our platform, investing in some ICO wil be peace of cake (btw i would like to have one now :) )</div>
