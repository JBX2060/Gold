We believe that as cryptocurrency adoption further penetrates businesses and the lives of consumers, there will be a point where; buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrency will be a part of everyday living. The payment platform is built to work with existing credit card infrastructure; including credit/debit cards and will employ payment processing protocols and flows for cryptocurrency similar to traditional electronic payment systems. This approach should enable easier and faster adoption of cryptocurrency as a mainstream payment platform, which in turn gives the merchants a higher level of convenience to accept any method of payment that is presented to them by the customer.</span></div><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>OUR PLATFORM</b></span></div><br /><div align="center"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/DUMWjSf.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/DUMWjSf.jpg</a> (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKJsqsiFunM)</div><br /><div align="center"><b>Payment Gateway</b><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">Our payment gateway is a PayPal like interface that allows merchants to collect fiat or cryptocurrency payment for their goods and services.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Such platforms are already there, but the more there are, the better, as there will be a choice. The more choices, the lower the exchange commission. Also there is a plus - debit and credit cards. But, it obliges to create a powerful security system.</div>

To be successful, you have to insure that there is no fraudulent activity, by either buyer or sell. Which is why we will implement a resolution center for our cryptocurrency transactions. However, unlike visa and mastercard, we will not have a biased towards to consumer and will try make the process as fair as possible.</div>

Also, just as Paypal, if the seller follows our guidelines when completing a shipment, we may decided to honor both parties and fund the loss from liquidity pool. However, we will use a set of algorithms to track the history of behaviour of both; buyer and seller, to judge future resolutions.</div>

This combination will help us serve both types of merchants, offering options to smaller sellers as they progress with their business and sales. For Cryptocurrency, it would serve both big or small.&nbsp; <br /><br />Escrow are funds that are held between two parties, via a third party, for a service or product to be completed/provided. In retailer/commercial, sellers need access to their money instantly, therefore, funds need to be transfer instanously. (i.e buying a coffee, access to a service online)&nbsp; However, even in a escrow payment method, if a conflict were to arise, a resolution center would be essential in&nbsp; mediating the issue. <br /></div>

Also, just as Paypal, if the seller follows our guidelines when completing a shipment, we may decided to honor both parties and fund the loss from liquidity pool.

I have heard that there are rulings from authorities that Paypal has no right to make a final decision because they are not a court. And to me it makes a lot of sense.

Our point of sale software should be available for public beta testing within the next couple of weeks. Following that release, we shall have a demo video, displaying the software&#039;s features on our smart payment terminal. Within 3-5 month we shall have completed the deployment Architecture integration of both devices, meaning that we can plug in any payment gateway, be it ours or a third party.

There is Pundi X solution with POS devices and they are going to deploy them soon.<br /><br />What about your regulatory approvals?<br /></div><br /><br />We personally do not believe that there is a comparable &nbsp;product to BaapPay on the market. Yes, there are similarities with different projects, however, they do not offer all the functionalities into one project. &nbsp;One project may offer a liquidity pool, however, they might not offer fiat merchant services. Another project may offer a Appstore, &nbsp;however, will use a third party to process their payments, and etc. &nbsp;Our platform combines many aspects; Payment gateway, POS, and app store and even a cryptocurrency exchange. &nbsp;Also, will do not want to be dependent upon third party services, ie, processing payments under a third visa/mastercard account, as they may deny your service at any time, if some sort of issues were to arise. <br /><br />Pundix looks like a really great project, however, I think you are comparing two different projects. Unlike Pundix, on our platform, our merchants do not have to use our POS system. A third party company can develop and deploy their own POS app on our system. &nbsp;In this situation, merchants would just use our payment gateway, devices, app store. &nbsp;Example. &nbsp;company X is a well know POS software company, they can develop and deploy their app onto our platform. Company X would not be limited to only our platform. As they may have another payment processor for their android/ ios platform. &nbsp;Company X now offers their customers different options and are not restricted to one payment processor. In addition, developers may port apps from android or develop specialty apps for our devices and integrate them into any POS app. <br /><br />We also offer a economical device, “MPOS” which can turn your desktop, mobile or tablet into a payment terminal. &nbsp;Another feature is the liquidity pool, giving merchants the option to convert crypto in fiat and guaranteeing the transaction in seconds. <br /><br />As for product deployment, we are not that far behind Pundi X(in terms of deploying the same type service), as our POS should be ready for public beta testing within the next couple of weeks and a full release soon after. Within 3-5 months we shall have completed the deployment architecture integration of both devices, meaning that we can plug in any payment gateway, be it ours or a third party. ( which is what i think they are deploying now). Therefore, even though we will started 4 months after them, if were were deploying the same services,(we still have the payment gateways and app store to develop) we would only be 3-5 months behind. &nbsp;Also, we are not sure if they are offering PCI certified devices, however, in most first world countries, ie North America, Many European countries etc. only PCI certified devices are allowed to be integrate and transmit payments. However, with that said, it still looks like a great project.<br /><br />As for regulations, it is dependant upon each region and country. Each will have their own rules and regulations that must be complied with. Thus, our system will have limitations and will be developed to each region’s regulations which would be relayed according to the users IP.<br /></div>

Any particular places who wants to implement your system?<br /></div><br />Actually, we are based in Canada, thus, will be going after the North American Market first. We will be releasing different parts of our system into the market, instead of releasing as a complete product. For example, the POS should be fully completed by the end of the ICO and the integration of our two devices with the POS and payment terminal will be complete within 4-5 months. Since our fiat and crypto payment gateways are not yet completed, we will develop partnerships with companies like Firstdata and bitpay, coingate etc, to integrate to offer Merchants access to devices, Point of sale and the ability to process fiat and crypto. Also, since our Point of sale software comes in English, French, Spanish, German, Indonesian, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, Vietnamese, we will be able to ship out our devices worldwide. <br /><br />However, the above mentioned will be implemented until we devlop our own gateways ( however, depending on region, we may integrate our crypto gateway with other crypto gateways, which are better suited to deal with that region.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </div>

To build a gateway is very complex and difficult, however, since we are trying to build a PayPal like gateway, integrating crypto and fiat, the complexity increases 100x. Yet, we are very fortune that we have a team with a financial/payment background, making this project possible. </div>

For example, if we were to release just the Point of sale software, would have different requirements. Thus, within a month or two of completion, we would be able to integrate payment for both fiat and crypto, via third party. Our liquidity pool etc, would not be applicable at this time. At this time, we might offer an option of Bitcoin convert to Eur (only these currencies) to your bank account, however, if this were to be implemented, transactions would be not instantaneously. You would need to wait for full confirmations. (this function would be apart of our full platform). <br /><br />For the devices, although they may have the capability of receiving and transmitting payment (which you will be able to see in the demo), however, without proper certifications and meeting standard requirements, we will not be able to obtain payment licensing. (North American has stricter standards than other countries) &nbsp;This why we have stated in our road map, that device integration will be released in Q3. &nbsp;More specifically we expect it to be 5-6 months, as payment processor / Acquirer would than need to verify the certifications and standards of the devices and receiving/transmitting capabilities. <br /><br />As for our full complete platform payment gateway, again, will need to proper certifications and meet standard requirements to obtain any type of payment license. Thus, as stated before, payment licensing will be required as correlated to what is being released. &nbsp;</div>

However, we are explaining the difference between the two projects. &nbsp;<br /><br />We cannot locate their Whitepaper since the link is not active, however, we will make references to prior articles, <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;from https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/pundi-x/<br /><br />The company wants to make it easier for brick-and-mortar businesses to accept digital currencies in-store, <br />Our aim is to serve both online and offline retailers, not just brick and mortar. &nbsp;<br /><br />The system involves the following core features:<br /><br /><br />The Pundi X Pass, which lets you store cryptocurrency securely, buy and sell digital tokens with a single swipe, and spend it over a card at Pundi X POS terminals<br />At the moment, we will not offer a &quot;BaapPay&quot; card to purchase items, on our platform you need to use our wallet/accounts<br /><br />Mobile payment integration, with digital wallets that you can use to buy, sell, and accept cryptocurrency (Pundi X plans to integrate itself with existing digital wallet solutions)<br />We will not integrate with digital wallets at this time. However, since our POS software is almost ready to be released, will integrate our POS with existing payment gateways, <b>. However</b>, that is not in our road map because it is not our final product. We plan to be our own payment gateway solution.(depending on the region, we might partner up with another gatway solution in conjunctions with ours.) &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Top-up using fiat currencies or a bank card at any Pundi X location; or, top up your balance over your mobile wallet<br />We will not have this function, as our system is not based on a card. Balances, crypto and fiat, will available on our payment gateway accounts. These account will be connect to your bank account and wallet. <br /><br />Use cryptocurrency to pay utility bills<br />As of this moment, we do not have the option because we do not offer a card that can be funded,<br /><br />Use cryptocurrency to buy and sell goods<br />this is basic of all payments<br /><br /><b>WHAT THEY HAVE THAT WE DO NOT<br /></b><br />establish credit history and reduce financial risk- We do not offer this function<br /><br />intelligence clearing system to increase the value of the store properties We do not have this function, however, if I understand correctly, it can be comparable to our liquidity pool. Yet, our liquidity pool is not based upon prior sales and history which is incorporated into a intelligence system. Our liquidity pool is based upon available funds, regardless past history <br /><br />Recently, they have added the options of <br /><br />3rd party Payment gateway integration,<br />Again, We will integrate with third parties <b>. However</b>, that is not in our road map because it is not our final product. We plan to process the payment ourselves with our gateway. <br /><br />support alipay, e2pay, go-pay etc We are not sure how they are going to do this, however, in our system, this payment would not go directly to the account holder account. It would be processed as a debit payment and processed through the payment gateway. <br /><br /><b>WHAT WE OFFER THEY DO NOT HAVE</b> (from our understanding)<br /><br />Our Own App store (dev can hold account within our payment gateway for payment)<br />Our own Fiat &amp; cryptocurrency payment gateway<br />Fiat-crypto conversion with your own account<br />fait-fait conversion with your own account<br />third party POS integration<br />Liquidity pool &nbsp;<br />Ecom Fiat &amp; cryptocurrency payment gateway<br />Resolution center <br />Connect bank account to BaapPay account<br /><br /><b>SIMILARITIES</b><br /><br />POS system<br />Devices,<br />Selling and buying crypto, ( however, ours will be done within our payment gateway) <br /><br />Since it is a payment system, there will also be other similarities.<br /><br /><b>NOTE</b><br /><br />It would be impossible for us to copy their idea, considering the fact that we are in the process of releasing our POS software. Also, a platform of this magnitude cannot be reseached or developed with a couple of months. The research has been in place for over a 1 year. &nbsp;<br /><br /><b>YOUR OTHER QUESTON</b><br /><br />As for SDK, why would that be regulated? If you are referring to integration of fiat and crypto,we are in a different situations. Yes, there are strict regulations, however, if followed properly, with proper connections, it can be done. Also, we are located in Canada and pundix is located in Indonesia. Please refer to the below<br /><br />https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-pundi-x/<br /><br />Jurisdiction risks. Will this device be legally allowed in retail stores? Pundi responds to this question, “The Indonesian authority has stated that cryptocurrency can be bought and sold as virtual goods. However, it is not allowed to be treated as currency. We will abide by this rule. We are in the final phrase of agreement to use an e-money license with a partnering company. According to Indonesian law, an e-money license is one of the essential licenses in the Fintech business in Indonesia, it allows the user to deposit, pay, withdraw and transfer money online. We are also actively seeking counsel from Indonesia’s Central Bank (BI) and Financial Service Authority (OJK). -1?<br /><br /><br />As stated many times before, we are not here to contemplate the better project of the two. It is great to see a project that is actually launching their product into the market. This is only beneficial for &nbsp;pundix, however, us and the rest of the crypto community. &nbsp;The greater crypto adoption amongst the public, the greater business opportunities we all receive. <br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dear colleagues, <br /><br />Do not invest in this project, ITS A SCAM. <br />I&#039;ve been translating Whitepaper, ANN and Bounty Threads and i didnt get paid and the bounty manager WAPINTER and BAAPPAY admin user are not answering my messages. <br /><br />I&#039;think we should create a thread or a way where we can report this SCAM projects in order to protect our jobs and our investments, i&#039;ve been working for 70 ICO BOunties, and i just received 9 payments, dont know if the projects are SCAM or the bounty managers are stealing us, because very very few bounty managers are changing the subject of the threads to SCAM to notify investors, or simply recognizing that it is a SCAM answering the messages they receive.<br /><br />Any other idea or proposal of how can we protect against this quickly growing problem?? <br /><br />Cheers,<br />EdChain<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At the moment, there is a need to introduce innovative financial instruments in the life of people.<br />The cryptocurrency market is growing and is entering our daily life with big steps, all online stores, as well as large trading networks, where you are currently buying, are on the threshold of implementing the methods of blockchain payments. There will come a time when buying, selling and trading with cryptocurrency will become part of daily activities.<br />I believe that the Platform Varrow introduces quick, safe and convenient crypto-payments in our daily lives! I wish the team a successful ICO and the implementation of all plans!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Usually, when you hear something is for free, it always seems like it’s too good to be true. Your instinctual reaction is to be skeptical. You assume that there has to some sort of catch. If not a catch, there must be some sort of loophole that they will eventually get me with that will end up costing me time or money or both.<br /><br />The team at BaapPay understands your skepticism. But we want to reassure you that we do not want anything from you. Our goal is simple: to make cryptocurrency as accessible as possible to as many people as possible across the world. It might seem like an ambitious task…and you’re right, it is! But we are committed to this journey. And this journey begins now, with the introduction of the Baap Pay Point-of-Sales (POS) System.<br /><br />The BaapPOS is a cloud based tool (see image below) that allows any sized brick and mortar store to take cryptocurrency payments. This means that people who want to pay for a soda or a book using Bitcoin or Ethereum, can easily do so at your retail establishment. But the best part about this software is that it is absolutely FREE! You didn’t read that wrong. Your eyes are not playing tricks on you. This POS is completely free!<br /><br />The BaapPOS can be used on multiple devices (i.e. laptops and mobile) as well as for multiple different business means. To learn more about this new tool, please visit the following link: https://baappaytoken.com/technology/#webbased<br /><br />If you’re interested in joining the dozens of others global merchants for early access to BaapPOS, please fill in your information on the following webpage:<br /><br />http://baappay.com/admin/signup/<br /><br />For any questions or if you’d like to join the discussion, feel free to become a part of our telegram group: https://t.me/BaapPay_Official.</div>
