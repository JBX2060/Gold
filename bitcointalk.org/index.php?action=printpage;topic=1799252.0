					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So as would appear to be my stupidity I seem to have lost the passphrase to unlock my bitcoin wallet. I thought I had had it backed up but it would appear not :( I have plenty of backups of my wallet but they are all locked. I also have the log file from when the wallet was encrypted. I looked into unlocking it with some of the recovery tools but I believe I used a random string of characters with no &quot;passphrase&quot; My question is is it possible (please I hope so) to brute force the password. I believe the password is around 25 characters long. I don&#039;t care if it would take a long time to determine. I have a server I can dedicate to this task full time with 24 threads available to help brute force the password. Someone give me some good news please :(</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">With a random string of 25 characters, it is incredibly unlikely that you will be able to brute force your wallet. In fact, it is basically impossible. Unfortunately your Bitcoin is now lost.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok so dug really deep and I was able to find my password on an old system backup (thank god). However when I try to use it it says its incorrect. So I then ran the password through btrecover with the password I found and a %P wildcard at the end. It said it found the password. The issues is it is indicated that a line return character was the missing character. How would that even be entered into the passphrase? Really appreciate any help!</div>

Some people cut and paste it directly to bitcoin-qt. Other cut and paste it to a command prompt window using &quot;bitcoin-cli walletpassphrase ...&quot; . It is a common problem for the users of non-US-English Windows that various things typed on the keyboard result in different characters feed to the program. Now that you mentioned a program from the Microsoft Office suite I&#039;m also aware that those programs in particular are known for creating problems by automagically changing entered texts to make them look better: e.g. &quot;smart quotes&quot;, auto ligatures (ffi, etc.) and other traps for unwary.<br /></div>

In the original btc-recover thread somebody made a good post about how to meditate to get into that state of mind one had at the time of entering that password first time.<br /><br />Microsoft Windows is particularly nasty with this regard because it is well known that the automatic driver updates may change the behavior of the keyboard/mouse/video card combination.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Had I not found my saved passphrase there is no way I would have been able to recover it. Unfortunately no amount of meditation would help me remember 24 completely random characters. Even after I found it I needed the &nbsp;btrecover tool to figure it out since the last character was incorrectly copied into the BTC client. I guess live and learn. Next time I&#039;ll be more careful with where I save my files and how I copy them. Thank god I take full backups of all my machines and keep them long term and there are some really smart people out there willing to help and create tools to help other people out.</div>

Too many people here thought that they have &quot;random number generators&quot;, but the real entropy was significantly lower (e.g. under 15 or 31 bits). It has been a common problem and frequent reason of the thefts: it looked random but it wasn&#039;t.<br /><br />Since you&#039;ve admitted to using Excel I just hope that you didn&#039;t use the builtin functions to generate those &quot;completely random characters&quot;. In fact, I wanted to encourage you to read this forum and re-check the source of your randomness. In the past people here discussed the flaws in various tools (commercial and free) that purport to generate random numbers.</div>
