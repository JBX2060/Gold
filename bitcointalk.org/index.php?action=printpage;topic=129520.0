As soon as someone created an alternate client where this problem (assuming it is a problem) had been solved or mitigated the blockchain would split. Anyone who did nothing and maintained their coins in both blockchains would be unaffected no matter which of the two won the battle that was about to ensue. Some people would sit idally by and do nothing, however some people would exchange the coins from one blockchain into the other in the hopes of profiting. These people would be the ones who decided which of the two forks would &quot;be bitcoin&quot;. Which ever side attracted more capital in the end would &quot;become bitcoin&quot;. Those who bet correctly would win at the expense of those who bet incorrectly. It is also possible that people would really be divided on whether the change was a good idea, if this was the case than the two blockchains would co-exist the way bitcoin and litecoin do now. <br /><br />(this all assumes that the guy who said this problem wasnt self adjusting was correct i did get two different contradicting responses)</div>

Sure, there could be a positive equilibrium fee. But the equilibrium is chosen based on throwing darts and it is quite likely to produce a shit turd equilibrium. Worse yet, because of the rigidity involved in making any change to the rules, we could end up mired in shit turds for the indefinite future. The moniker Buttcoin could prove quite apt.<br /><br />Q_D(p)=a-bp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Txn demanded per block (Q_D) is a function of p, the price per txn. I&#039;m assuming it is linear here just for simplicity.<br />Q_S=min{a,4000)} <br /><br />4000 is just the number of txns that can fit with the current &nbsp;block size limit. If a&lt;4000, then the fee is approximately 0. This is the current equilibrium with 0 or minimal fees. <br /><br />If a&gt;4000, then there will be equilibrium fees. You can just set Q_D=Q_S and solve the equation to get equilibrium fees.<br /><br />4000=a-bp<br />p*=(a-4000)/b<br /><br />That is the fee with a block size limit. It goes up as demand increases (a). It will go down if substitutes for bitcoin are developed (this would increase b).<br /><br />Consider the monopoly situation, where the monopoly picks block size. In this case, the monopoly maximizes total feel revenue (ignoring costs because those are hard to predict right now). That is p*q, or ap-bp^2. The solution is just given by a=2bp, or p=a/2b<br /><br />If a/2b&lt;(a-4000)/b, then the monopoly (like Paypal), leads to lower fees than the current plan. Rearranging. This is<br />a&gt;8000<br /><br />Essentially this says that if people demand more than 2 MB blocks at a txn fee of 0, then monopoly leads to lower fees than a block size cap of 1 MB.<br /><br />The whole example is ad hoc because I assumed a linear demand curve. Nevertheless, the example illustrates what utter and complete garbage a block size cap is. Usually we try to do better than monopoly. Here it seems quite plausible, even likely, that we will do worse on all counts.<br /><br />There are many other solutions which make more sense. Many of these alternatives are also bad and arbitrary. However, the solution at hand is really fucking extraordinarily bad and really fucking extraordinarily arbitrary. It can simultaneously fail on both security grounds and txns cost grounds. If the cap results in a functional outcome, you can thank dumb luck because I&#039;m sure as hell that no thought process went into this.<br /><br />In short, the current plan is utter and complete fail. Anyone who says otherwise is completely full of shit and cannot be competent to make this type of decision (i.e. if they were competent, they never would have suggested anything remotely as stupid as this.). The developers know this is utter and complete shit. They suggest otherwise when speaking in public to avoid damage to confidence. <br /><br />Of course, if they wanted to solve the problem, they would say: &quot;Hey we have a problem, does anyone have any ideas?&quot;<br /><br /></div>

(To see this, set the limit to an arbitrarily large number in the previous example. The txn fee will be negative, but that is not feasible so it will stop decreasing when it hits 0.)<br /><br />This could actually manages to do worse then the current plan and much worse than monopoly. The outcome assures that the blockchain open for rape by any common vandal. At least the other plan has a chance of succeeding due to dumb luck.<br /><br />Surprisingly, this is actually another one of the developers&#039; plans. Support the blockchain using &#039;donations&#039;. LOL! You can start by donating to miners today! I&#039;m sure this will top everyone&#039;s list of charitable causes.<br /><br />The only realistic way to get an acceptable solution to a problem like this is through voting. Probably coin-owners should suggest a fee. And the fee proposed by the median coin should be selected. They could also vote on a block size limit. As far as economics is concerned the two are equivalent. In the blockchain, you could probably instrument this by including votes in each txn and weighting them by output. Probably a vote to move the current fee up by 0.1% or down by 0.1% is sufficient. i.e. this is just one byte of extra info per txn. You could even encode it in a pre-existing piece of information, like include 5 satoshis in the fee to vote up, 6 satoshis in the fee to vote down, and anything else to abstain. &nbsp;<br /><br />Algorithmic solutions are hopelessly complicated and error prone. I&#039;m an economist and do this kind of stuff for a living. I wouldn&#039;t trust an economist to design an algorithm to do this and not fuck up; let alone a computer scientist. The only reasonable thing an algorithm could target without a reasonable chance of seriously fucking up is the monopoly solution (total fee revenue maximization). I would say this is a second best option to actual voting.<br /><br />Finally, recall that proof-of-stake solves this problem entirely without meaningful fees. There would still be a fee to vote on, but you could vote for an extremely small fee just sufficient to deter spam.</div>

We can can probably deal with high future fees by introducing extra systems that use Bitcoin as backing.
