					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If I understand it correctly, we can immediately take advantage of what they offer.<br /><br />Create some cryptocoin exchanges on Tor, which trades both Bitcoins and zerocoins, people can then start laundering their money through the zerocoin blockchain.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Subverting the states power too much would result in the deployment of their nearly unlimited resources to combat the &quot;problem.&quot; This makes me question whether or not these less complex solutions are adequate--or if any of the proposed solutions are.</div>

This seems like a reasonable idea me, it lets us test Zerocoin, and if it works well, we can merge it into Bitcoin (without the risk of damaging Bitcoin if something goes wrong).<br /></div>That&#039;s a great idea from a purely technical perspective.<br /><br />Realize that when money is at stake other factors will come into play.<br /><br />Zerocoin is a highly desired feature. As soon as they release this coin, it&#039;s going to attract investment and it&#039;s exchange rate will rise quickly. People are going to put a considerable amount of money into Zerocoin.<br /><br />When Bitcoin implements these features, it will threaten the value of their investment. Do you think they are going let that happen calmly? They will do everything they can to obstruct the change. They&#039;ll come over here and spread FUD, start arguments, and in general make life difficult for any developer seeking to push the change.<br /><br />This happens already - If you go back to the beginning of this year and read through flamewars regarding scalability and the blocksize and pay attention to the people most fervently opposed to large transaction rates, with the most ridiculous and economically absurd arguments, and then check their posting history you&#039;ll find that in almost all cases they were heavily involved with altcoins.<br /></div></div>

Well, because except for Litecoin, 99.999999% of all the other alt-coins are just crappy-coins from people that can manage to search-copy-replace text. Litecoin is only valuable to bitcoin because the main developer there can manage to contribute back.<br /><br />Why, again, is it needed, you ask ? Well, start following some of the key developers for bitcoin and you will quickly realize that their line of thought are no longer aligned with the original proposal, or even with the idea of open source software.</div>

Lets count that: four tightly written paragraphs, one verbatim quote, cross-posted on two forums, and results? Over three main threads we&#039;ve got 32k hits and 811 replies on this forum alone, including responses by people worth listening to like Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell, an article on CoinDesk (http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-tracking-proposal-divides-bitcoin-community/), CoinJoin bounty is up +8 BTC and the Dark Wallet campaign is nearly fully funded (http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bitcoin-dark-wallet) - that&#039;s some effective complaining. Not so effective computer security, but yeah... I&#039;m pissed off about that.<br /><br />You on the other hand, you&#039;re just annoying people like myself who are actually flying halfway across the world in two weeks to go make CoinJoin happen and make Mike&#039;s misguided ideas about blacklists irrelevant. So I dunno, unless you want to surprise me by showing me that you&#039;re good at getting shit done, go away. Delete your trolling posts while you&#039;re at it.<br /><br />And you know, if you want to get better at it, you can start by saying things that actually make sense.</div>

It&#039;s hard to say much of anything useful without more information being made public.<br /><br />I would note that the prior ZC implementation has been made available for some time now, and no altcoin has picked it up.</div>

Validating nodes need only keep the root hash for a given series, which is updated after validating each spend.<br /></div>Sounds a lot like the MMR stuff Peter Todd has been talking about, but I don&#039;t think it applies in the anonymous context.<br /><br />In an anonymous system the unspent coins are blinded in some way or another and you use a proof to show that your spend is spending a coin from the set of unspent coins (without revealing which blind-unspent coin it was), and then that unblinded coin is put into a list to prevent spending it again.<br /><br />Any way that avoids the storage problem by linking the spend to the particular unspent coin (e.g. removing it) isn&#039;t anonymous.<br /><br />I know how to prevent it from growing forever though, but it trades off the anonymity set and the reliability of storage:. E.g. you have generations of unspent coins, and all unspent coins from a particular generation must be spent before a certain time. Once that time passes your spent list can also be purged.<br /><br />At least in what Peter Todd&#039;s been thinking about there is an additional complication that when adjacent branches in this updating tree of unspent outputs you must update your proof... so it creates an interesting business opportunity for nodes that track the whole state in order to help offline spenders figure out the proof they need.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, it&#039;s exactly MMR applied to the Chaum token double-spend db. This solves the problem of maintaining that ever-increasing list of unblinded, spent tokens by pushing the problem out of the validators and onto the people holding the coins. Proof size grows with log2 the number of spent tokens, but the proofs can be thrown away once validated (as they can be reconstructed from the block chain history).<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t link the spend to the original coin however, as we&#039;re only dealing with revelation of the unblinded tokens. You still need some sort of ZKP that the unblinded token was out of the original set of blinded tokens.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Got it, for some reason I was not seeing that the coin owner knows their (blinded) coin ID from the moment the coin is created, and thus can track the proof for where that coin belongs in the spent tree... or they could not do so and trust that they&#039;ll be able to find someone else who has when they need it. Makes sense.<br /></div>
