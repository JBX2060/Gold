					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you download blocks from a client server site like bitcoincharts instead of waiting for the bitcoin client to update through peer to peer, what exactly are the risks? Can the bitcoin client belong to a bitcoin fork and can the coins in the wallet become worthless?</div>
