					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That happened to me yesterday too. It took almost 3 hours for the first confirmation and about that much more time to get all 6. I kept checking and rechecking the address I sent it to convinced I had pasted it in wrong or something. And yes, I freaked out a little too, lol.&nbsp; In the end, everything went through fine. I know its hard, but just wait. Do something in the meantime to keep your mind off worrying. Hang in there McLovin&nbsp; :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve got my fingers crossed for you guys. I really hope that all works out for everyone, I really do. I didn&#039;t invest because I don&#039;t have the extra cash or I would have. I should have picked brokegirl instead of bitgirl as my name, lol, but I like to think positive I guess&nbsp; :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, always pay transaction fees. I&#039;m slowly but surely figuring this all out. Thanks for the reminder Stephen. You probably saved another noob like me from learning the hard way.&nbsp; :)</div>
