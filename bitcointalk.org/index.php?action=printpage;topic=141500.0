					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anyone else having issues with looking up transactions or addresses on the blockchain? I can&#039;t seem to do it from anywhere, and my Bitcoin-qt platform seems to think I need to upgrade even though I&#039;m running the latest version. I&#039;m a little nervous because I wanted to send a transaction, and I can&#039;t even double check that I have the BTC in the right address. Normally I could at least do that.</div>
