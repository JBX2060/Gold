					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bitcoin sends some &quot;change&quot; back to a fresh address that&#039;s supposed to be in your wallet. What if somebody changed that to be in their wallet instead... Would you even notice?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Such a thing would immediately be visible in the block chain... so it&#039;s more FUD. Seems they knew there was a leaker in the channel so they spewed nonsense to see where it would turn up.<br /><br /><br /></div>
