					Post by: <b>rahl</b> on <b>January 27, 2013, 02:12:05 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been trying to get the blockchain in various ways for about 2 weeks or something now.<br /><br />There are various problems. After 6 hours or so bitcoin-qt.exe is up to using over 2 gb of ram and then it crashes.<br /><br />The db.log file becomes huge, at one point it was over 3GB.<br /><br />The blockchain files are basically not growing at all, just the first few minutes after lauching the client it will take of then pretty much nothing happens for a very long while. I have plenty of connections and such and not done anything special with the installation on Windows 7.<br /><br />I tried decrypting my SSD and running bitcoin it without any modifications on a unencrypted SSD with 1Gbit internet connection for a few days and it was just as slow and stalling just as much. It is the latest version of the client.<br /><br /><br />On my laptop running Ubuntu I managed to get the whole thing downloaded in 3-4 days. I tried moving those files and do -loadbock with them. I ended up with a blk0001 of about 200meg, it didnt import the rest from those working blockchain files.<br /><br />Any ideas? Any more info that might be helpfull?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hio :)<br /><br />Is your cpu and/or ram overclocked ?<br /><br />Are the motherboard&#039;s and SSD&#039;s drivers and/or bios up to date ?<br /><br />If all is good, check the sata cable(s) to make sure they are sitting flush. Something might be pulling on them.<br /><br />pEACe</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nothing overclocked and cables seems ok. <br />I am not having any bluescreens or any other problems with the computer now and it is stable for months without reboot ... so the hardware should be ok.<br /><br />The db.log is like this<br /><br />PANIC: DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run database recovery<br />wallet.dat: unable to flush page: 91<br />txn_checkpoint: failed to flush the buffer cache: DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run database recovery<br />PANIC: fatal region error detected; run recovery<br />then now 300mb of that last line...<br /><br />the only errors i can find in debug looks something like this and it is full of them:<br />ERROR: FetchInputs() : 0cd82b8737 mempool Tx prev not found 848af2646b<br />stored orphan tx 0cd82b8737 (mapsz 10001)<br />mapOrphan overflow, removed 1 tx<br /><br />also when I clean the datadir I can no longer use the wallet.dat because it says it is corrupted and have to restore the backup from before I replaced the SSD.<br /><br />Bitcoin-qt.exe is also crashing with unexpected runtime error when I do stuff like try to add or rename addresses or change the wallet password.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How are the system&#039;s temperatures ?<br /><br />Some other things I would try ...<br /><br />- run everything possible as Admin or enable the hidden Admin acct and use that for all updates and installs.<br />- install and update service pack 1, .NET 4.0 and Microsoft visual C++ 2008/2010 x86/x64<br />- disable the firewall and antivirus<br />- fresh install windows</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">troubleshooting here, would you:<br />1. Shut down Bitcoin-QT.<br />2. Open task-manager and make sure bitcoin isn&#039;t running.<br />3. Then try moving everything in the C:/Users/&quot;You Username&quot;/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin directory to a temporary location.<br />4. Start Bitcoin-QT back up.<br /><br />If it runs successfully like this then it means you have a corrupt file. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Temperatures are fine there is almost no load on the cpu from bitcoin and very little disk and network usage also.<br />Windows was just installed, that is why the bitcoin is gone. C++ and .NET are up to date<br /><br />With a clean wallet file I don&#039;t get bitcoin crashing when chainging addresses and the likes. But I think I already tried it and the download was no different. I will try it again....<br /><br />But I still need to use my old wallet file because blockchain.info will not import all of the bitcoins from that wallet file...</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You can import the blockchain from your other bitcoin client by selecting the option detach database on shutdown on BOTH the clients.&nbsp; Then you can simply copy the blk00x.dat and blkindex.dat files to the bitcoin directory on windows computer.<br /><br />Note: Bitcoin-QT takes longer to shut down when this option is checked so make sure bitcoin isn&#039;t running before copying the files.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Before reinstalling Windows did you happen to have 0.7.2 Beta?<br />I&#039;m not entirely sure but it may be the cause of your wallet transfer.<br />Somebody should correct me if I&#039;m wrong.</div>
