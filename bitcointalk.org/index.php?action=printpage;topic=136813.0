					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The normal bitcoin client isn&#039;t such a fantastic tool for regular users (read: totally normal users). <br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be possible to build an instawallet type service that sat directly on the users main computer? What would be the advantages/disadvantages of this? Obviously you would still need bitcoin running, much like Armory, but would it pave the way for people to develop skins, different layouts, more convenient interfaces? Or would it just be an additional security nightmare?<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Blockchain.info already provide a wallet service for newbies to keep their wallets accessible from a web interface while keeping their money secure.<br /><br /><br />Regards<br />BitcoinOxygen<br /></div>

I mean someone could write a java/python program that didn&#039;t require that and already had a server embed, but i don&#039;t know sounds actually harder.</div>
