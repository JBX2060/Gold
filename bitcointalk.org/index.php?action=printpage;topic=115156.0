					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No, there is practically nothing you can do to get 4 confirmations faster than 40 minutes on average.<br /><br />You need to check your assumptions. Why do you need 4 confirms? Double-spending is very unlikely to be a problem for physical PoS. In the future there will be ways to get instant confirmation for payments.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sadly, this is the problem with Bitcoin, slow confirmations. I was recently at the supermarket, and this lady was paying with her debit card, but it took a while to sort things through as it was apparently cancelled. I had to wait around 10 minutes and the line had increased. If this is what I must endure if Bitcoin becomes global, then sorry, Bitcoin will be doomed to fail.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You don&#039;t need a globally recorded block chain transaction to buy things in your supermarket. If the supermarket screws you over, you go to a different one. Until then, you just trust them they don&#039;t steal a bag of food&#039;s worth from you.<br /><br />Such things can be handled by cheap payment processors, and if you&#039;re paranoid some block chain escrow to keep it from running with its user accounts. It&#039;s a complete waste of bandwidth and storage to do the single transactions on the block chain.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I wouldn&#039;t bother waiting for 4 confirmations unless the transaction was in a four-digit range or higher (if it was a 5-digit or higher one maybe you should wait for 6 confirmations). <br />I&#039;m not sure about 0-conf transactions but 1-conf should be enough for anything below $500-1k (so most PoS transactions).<br /><br />You should first ask yourself a few questions:<br /><br />Who is able to do double-spends? <br />If they are, how much would it cost them? <br /></div>

Gox account after one confirmation (as long as your Mt. Gox account is verified, 2 confirmations with no verification.)<br /><br />&nbsp; - http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=102176.0<br /><br />So simply obtain a Bitcoin address for payment from SMPAKE and give that to the customer.<br /><br />That cuts your problem down significantly.<br /><br />If you want 0/confirmations, just make sure the merchant&#039;s node is configured properly (no incoming transactions, explicit outgoing connection to well-connected nodes) and possibly offer to insure by assessing a small fee on each transaction that covers the cost should any race attacks or Finney attacks be succesful.</div>

You just increase the margin on the products to account for occurrence of the fraud.<br /><br />By waiting less than 10 seconds, you will be able to validate a 0 confirm transaction doesn&#039;t have an existing double spend, so then you only have to worry about a Finney attack, which will be so rare that the money you save in not paying a credit card processor will more than make up for it.</div>

Bitcoins are for purchasing drugs on Silk Road, paying for hacker taking out your rival companies and so on. Bitcoins are a unique niche product.<br /><br />And someone might say that faster confirmations will increase blockchain size and bitcoins will fail because of that.
