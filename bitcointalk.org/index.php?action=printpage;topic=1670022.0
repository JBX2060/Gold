					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have an idea I&#039;d like to transform into code, particularly a blockchain very similar to Bitcoin created from scratch, with different consensus and mining rules.&nbsp; Essentially a distributed ledger, just functioning differently.&nbsp; However, I can&#039;t program well in C++, I&#039;d be spending months learning compiler directives and what&#039;s going on in the code.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already tried figuring out the Litecoin source, and it&#039;s essentially meaningless to me.&nbsp; I have a basic understanding of C, but large Cpp projects are literally foreign to me.&nbsp; I come from a strong Python/web development background (I&#039;m a beta programmer, stuck to interpreted languages) but need a blockchain, so I was wondering whether or not it would be impossible to create a chain from scratch on a scripting language?&nbsp; I know Cpp is better for numerous reasons, but do you at least think it&#039;s possible so I&#039;m not wasting my time?&nbsp; Those with experience, is there any merit to creating a blockchain with an interpreted language, or are there reasons for which this is destined to be an absolute failure?&nbsp; I understand all the theory of blockchains and how they work, but I don&#039;t have the programming skills to apply those concepts in anything more complicated than Python.&nbsp; I can write Bitcoin transactions, work with API&#039;s, etc. in Python, but the actual Cpp source for whole projects, along with creating genesis blocks and what have ypu is currently exponential degrees of magnitude out of my league.<br /><br />I&#039;ve become obsessed and depressed stressing over recent global affairs, and because of this I can&#039;t think about anything besides this idea in my mind, my productivity has been reduced to zero.&nbsp; I&#039;ve thought about getting a partner to write the chain portion of the project, but I can&#039;t rely on other people for all the actual work so I figure if my last option is learn Cpp I will strap down and learn it.&nbsp; If Python is not an option and I must learn a compiled language, where should I start?&nbsp; Any essential reading?</div>

It can be done in python too. If python isnt your type, you can try Go, Rust, D, Ocaml, etc. </div>
