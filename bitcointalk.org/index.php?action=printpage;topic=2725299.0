					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBY-ANN-header.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBY-ANN-header.png</a><br /><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/SPV.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/SPV.png</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/WhatIsXtraBYtes.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/WhatIsXtraBYtes.png</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">XTRABYTES is a blockchain / modules platform and associated cryptocurrency that introduces several key innovations that provide significant security and scalability advantages over current crypto technologies on the market.<br /><br />The goal of XTRABYTES is to provide a platform on which a multitude of customized services can be deployed and utilized. Several blockchain solutions provide a similar offering, but XTRABYTES is unique in that it is backed by and built upon a secure, powerful, and reliable network.<br /></span><br /><br /><b><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBY-WP-Ann.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBY-WP-Ann.png</a> (https://xtrabytes.global/whitepaper.pdf)</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/IMBI.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/IMBI.png</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBYservices.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBYservices.png</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">The XTRABYTES network will provide a highly customizable platform which enables developers to create and deploy a variety of tailored applications. Flexibility and ease-of-use are central to the design of the network, shortening the development process and allowing users to launch their projects quickly and efficiently. The goal is for XTRABYTES to serve as the host for an entire ecosystem of applications and services, all backed by the security and scalability advantages inherent in XTRABYTES&#039; core technology.<br /><br />On the XTRABYTES platform, these custom applications have been labeled modules, reflecting the fact that they are both independent and self-contained from other modules; each comprising an entirely separate application. Modules are segregated and can be created, updated, and deleted without impacting each other or disrupting the network in any way. &nbsp;They will offer plug-and-play functionality where modules can easily be connected to the XTRABYTES network and immediately draw upon its core features.<br /><br />The XTRABYTES development team plans to release several modules as a proof-of-concept and to provide several core services. &nbsp;The first of these will be comprised of a decentralized secure data storage, with several other services currently under consideration.<br /></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBYtechnology.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBYtechnology.png</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">XTRABYTES is powered by the Proof-of-Signature (PoSign) consensus algorithm, a unique and revolutionary approach to achieving distributed consensus which was created by Founder and Lead Developer, Zoltán Szabó (aka. Borzalom).<br /><br />In all other existing blockchain technologies, transactions are verified and blocks created by only one randomly selected node in the network. Common consensus algorithms such as Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, and Proof-of-Importance attempt to ensure that the node selected is not malicious or faulty, but they cannot guarantee that this is the case.<br /><br />PoSign comprises a radically different approach. Transactions are verified by a network of what are called STATIC nodes—importantly, each of these nodes must sign off on a transaction before the associated block can be appended to the chain. Should a malicious node repeatedly attempt to compromise the chain, it will be blacklisted automatically.<br /><br />STATIC nodes are the backbone of the XTRABYTES network. The word STATIC is derived from the words; Services Transactions and Trusted in Control, which is all of what defines our STATIC nodes in the simplest way.<br /><br /><b>SERVICES </b>- All modules attached to the XTRABYTES network must be served by at least 1 STATIC node. <br /><b>TRANSACTIONS</b> - All transactions are processed by the STATIC nodes. <br /><b>TRUSTED</b> - Each STATIC node is registered by a deposit of XBY and is known by the XTRABYTES network. <br /><b>CONTROL</b> - The STATIC network controls the entire XTRABYTES MODULAR BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM. <br /><br />The security improvements are profound—to compromise XTRABYTES, the entirety of the STATIC node network must be compromised and a single malicious actor cannot undermine the integrity of the blockchain. Additional benefits include substantially decreased energy consumption as the consensus algorithm does not require nodes to solve computationally difficult problems to earn transaction fees or create new tokens.<br /><br />A corollary of requiring each node to sign transactions is that these nodes be able to communicate with one another rapidly and seamlessly. To address these requirements, XTRABYTES has developed and introduces The VITALS (Virtual Information Transmissions ALigning STATIC&#039;s) Network.<br /><br />VITALS comprises a private network directly interconnecting the online STATIC nodes; &nbsp;effectively providing VPN-like functionality to the network. VITALS therefore supports the communication needs of the XTRABYTES blockchain by providing interference-free direct paths between nodes to ensure security and speed when processing transactions.<br /><br />The PULSE system relays messages between nodes and functions like an instant messaging service. Crucially, synchronicity is always maintained—offline nodes are automatically forwarded missed messages which they then sign when they come online again. These transmissions are always encrypted and timestamped, and cannot be altered.<br /><br /><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/XTRABYTES.TECH.PART.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/XTRABYTES.TECH.PART.png</a><br /><br /><b>A simple explanation of how this will function:</b><br /><br />XTRABYTES is built on a new and novel algorithm requiring none of the traditional mining supports typically seen in blockchains which rely on POW or POS. &nbsp;This new algorithm is called Proof of Signature (POSign).<br />&nbsp;<br />PoSign will ensure a signature rate of 100% for each block system wide, which is made possible through its network of STATIC nodes and a network of virtual nodes (The VITALS Network). &nbsp;The VITALS network is comprised of a fixed number of virtual nodes that corresponds to and is controlled by one or more real STATIC nodes.<br />&nbsp;<br />Block creation is controlled entirely through the communication (using PULSE) between the VITALS and the system of real STATIC nodes. <br /><br />When a transaction is created, it is verified by all of the STATIC nodes in the network. Once the transaction has been completely validated, the VITALS network enters the process to create the new blocks and achieve 100% signature validation of the newly created block. <br /><br />Using this method of block generation, we will be able to avoid transaction and block conflicts, while allowing every peer knowledge of who will create the new block and who will distribute the block first. <br /><b><br />What happens to a VITALS node and its block generating ability if a STATIC node is down or is being attacked via DDOS?</b><br /><br />Assume the S1 STATIC node controls the V1 virtual node. &nbsp;If a disruptive agent attacks and disables the S1 STATIC node then one or more of the other STATIC nodes will take control of the V1 VITALS node until the S1 STATIC node has been brought back online. <br /><br />All VITALS nodes are controlled by one or more STATIC nodes. &nbsp;If the number of STATICs is less than VITALS nodes then random STATICs will control additional VITALS nodes. <br /></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBYmodules.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBYmodules.png</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">Modules can be considered an extension to the XBY core and its functionality. &nbsp;They provide the use case for XTRABYTES, for everything from decentralized storage to instant messaging and all conceivable applications in between. &nbsp;The XTRABYTES core and DICOM API will provide programmers with an easy to grasp platform for development. &nbsp; A module can be coded using many different popular programming languages ranging from Visual Basic, Java, to C++. &nbsp;This makes XTRABYTES extremely flexible and opens up the creation of modules to third party developers; or anyone who knows a basic programming language. <br /><br />Modules are one of the simplest parts of the XTRABYTES structure and provide an excellent entry point for people to discover and learn about the XTRABYTES infrastructure. <br />&nbsp;<br />Once the validation process is complete, the modules will be loaded onto the XTRABYTES platform where they will be available in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the XTRABYTES wallet. &nbsp;Users can then choose which modules to run by enabling or disabling them.<br /><br />A module is no different from a regular application in that it can be independently created and tested. &nbsp;Once the module is ready, it can be easily connected to the XBY Module Core by using the Distributed Command Message Language Core or DICOM Application Programming Interface (API).<br /><br />The DICOM interface connects the external modules to the Module Core. The Module Core will verify and validate the modules. &nbsp;The Module Core is, in turn, connected to the XBY core. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The X-Bridge Interface has an important and vital function, as it establishes the connection between the old and the new chain. &nbsp;This is just one example of the functions that can be used by the modules.<br /><br />Due to the adaptable nature of module content many categories can be created and tailored to the module&#039;s individual purpose. &nbsp;Examples of categories include: &nbsp;Administration, Business, Commerce, Educational, E-Commerce, Finances, Games, Security, and many others. <br /><br /><b>How are modules obtained/integrated into the XBY platform?</b><br /><br />The aim is to make module integration as simple and fluent as possible. Think of familiar user platforms such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play.<br /><br /><b>How are modules programmed?</b><br /><br />Through use of the DICOM API developers are not limited to a single programming language; as is often the case with other blockchain technologies. Instead, we will provide an environment where they are free to program, using their preferred language and using DICOM API to deploy the module to the XTRABYTES eco-system.<br /><br />This results in very little restriction on developers and creates an environment limited only by the developer’s imagination. Decentralized exchanges, instant messaging, web hosting, you name it, can all be done on the XTRABYTES blockchain.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBYduediligence.png">https://xtrabytes.global/images/XBYduediligence.png</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please read the history of XBY.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m understanding the need for developer anonimity, but the nickname of the main developer and other contributors narrows they anonimity to 0.1% of what it can be when they called themselves for example cryptojohn. But maybe it&#039;s this clear only to 0.1% of people anyway. :)<br /><br />Good luck for the project! ;)</div>

In saying that, they did buy nodes relatively cheap and are first in line to receive cash from Dapps and fees. To me that in itself is a pretty massive reward, specially as time goes by and XBY starts dominating the crypto world.<br /><br />What I would like to see is further discussion on this and a middle ground found. Ie- reduce this registration fee so it does not disadvantage new investors too much. 100k seems greedy to me.&nbsp; I am not saying this from self interest as I have enough to cover a node + said fee. I would like a system put in place that benefits the whole community and promotes de-centralisation. In the end that is the dream of crypto isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />More to follow I am sure&nbsp; :)</div>

This fee will be shared between all nodes owners. So if u will register your node u will get part of every next registered node also. U will get part of fees from each L2 and L3 nodes also. <br /><br />Fees will grow. There will be 0 XBY fee for 1st L2 node and 50000 xby for last one L2 node. So every next node fee will grow from 0 to 50 000 xby In L3 nodes it will be same but it will grow from 0 to 25 000 XBY :) Remember every new registered node fee will be shared between current node owners.<br /></div><br />Bykerleszno,<br />Is this something that was agreed on by the original node holders?<br /><br />I understand that it is difficult to please everyone and Original Node owners did take a risk and have not being compensated for it. In saying that, they did buy nodes relatively cheap and are first in line to receive cash from Dapps and fees. To me that in itself is a pretty massive reward, specially as time goes by and XBY starts dominating the crypto world.<br /><br />What I would like to see is further discussion on this and a middle ground found. Ie- reduce this registration fee so it does not disadvantage new investors too much. 100k seems greedy to me.&nbsp; I am not saying this from self interest as I have enough to cover a node + said fee. I would like a system put in place that benefits the whole community and promotes de-centralisation. In the end that is the dream of crypto isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />More to follow I am sure&nbsp; :)<br /></div><br />Please note there is not many L1 nodes available. It is about 60-70 L1 nodes available to register because we have about over 440 already registered. We did list who want to register those nodes and there are more people than available slots. That is why I dont think we will lower it. It is question to CCRevlotuon but I think it will stay like it is. One thing we need to do is decide how we will decide who will able to register L1 nodes in first place because like I said there is more people than available slots. With L2 and L3 there will not be any problem because first come first serve. If u will be first to register first L2 node fee for you will be very small. If u will be second it still will be very low but not 0 anymore ;) It will grow slowly slowly until last nodes which will need additional fee about 50 000 XBY :) </div>

This was not an easy undertaking but it was necessary to ensure that all balances were correct before we could proceed. Everything is 100% accurate and this latest wallet update is now behind us on Cryptopia! We are pushing for other exchanges to update their wallets in due time. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><b><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">Business Registration</span></b> <br /><br />It is with great pleasure that I share our certificate of incorporation. XTRABYTES Ltd. has been incorporated as a Seychelles International Business Company (IBC). We felt this was the most secure option for your XTRABYTES and the future technology that we will be implementing.<br /><br />Adding to the registration process, we are pleased to also announce that there are 1 million shares of the company available in the future. At a later time we will determine the process in which members will be able to procure these shares, with STATIC owners being first in line. However, this is not something to pay a lot of attention to at this stage as we have much more important things to worry about! We simply wanted to make this announcement as a surprise and to reaffirm our stance as a community-focused company. <br /><br />Below you will find the PDF of our official registration, signed and notarized on January 11, 2018. <br /><br />XTRABYTES Company Registration (https://xtrabytes.global/downloads/XTRABYTES-Cerfificate-Incorporation.pdf) <br /><br />If you would like more information regarding our company registration, you can visit the Sterling Offshore website and request a Seychelles Company Database Search. Although it is a paid service, they can provide you with a certified declaration of our company’s good standing along with other additional information.<br /><br />Sterling Offshore Company Database Search (http://sterlingoffshore.com/services/company-registry-search-services/seychelles-company-registry-search/) <br /><br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">Testnet Extended</span></b><br /><br />Enough about the registration, let’s get to the tech! As I am sure many of you can appreciate, the curve balls that have been thrown at us recently regarding exchanges and wallets has made it extremely difficult to put the majority of our focus on the testnet. Rest assured we are closing these unplanned programming tasks and will resume pushing the testnet to the limit. Many of you have been actively sending and receiving test XBY on the testnet, which has resulted in some fantastic community bug reports. We are investigating these tickets and implementing new solutions almost every day. Once we are ready with a more stable testing platform we will make an announcement with further instructions on how to coordinate a network strike across all of our testnet participants.<br /><br /><br />Thank you all for your ongoing patience!<br /><br /><b>The XTRABYTES Team</b><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

As percocet said, the richlist in the block explorer reports that the top 100 addresses hold more than 100% of the total supply, while the rest hold a negative amount of XBY (which is not possible, obviously)</div>

You most likely have to resync the chain from the beginning.<br /><br />Locate your wallets data directory. This is where the blockchain and ‘wallet.dat’ is stored. <br />The default path is ‘C:\Users\your_windows_username\AppData\Roaming\xtrabytes’<br /><br />Or do the following<br />Hold the windows button and press R<br />In the box, write %appdata% then press enter<br />Go to Roaming<br />Go to Xtrabytes<br /><br /><br />Now select all the files and folder, except ‘wallet.dat’ and delete them. It’s very important that you leave ‘wallet.dat’ in the directory, it contains your coins.<br /><br /><br />Restart your wallet software and the synchronization process will start from scratch.<br /><br />You could also use the bootstrap here: http://xtrabytes.global/wallets/bootstrap.dat<br /><br />More information on that here: https://community.xtrabytes.global/threads/sync-the-xtrabytes-wallet-faster-with-the-bootstrap-dat-file.434/<br /><br />Hope that helps! </div>

I will look up the message history. <br /><br />But we place faith in our moderators and imo dedpull has done a great job as acting mod. We have a log of all banned members of the Discord and also a policy here:<br /><br />1. The general channel is created for XBY talk, please keep all off-topic items in the off-topic channel.<br /><br />2. Don&#039;t flood/spam the general channel, we need to maintain a clear chat. Please combine reactions into one reply<br /><br />3. Don&#039;t promote other coins in the general channel<br /><br />4. Keep it nice &amp; friendly, no calling names, racism, sexual explicit talk, triggering flamewars, etc...<br /><br />5. Respect XBY team members, they are investing time to help all members.<br /><br />6. People who can&#039;t follow these simple rules risk a kick or even a ban if the keep ignoring the rules.<br /><br />I disagree with your assertion that people are banned just for disagreements. As I said, all of this is documented in Discord. &nbsp;One of the reasons why it is so much better imo than Slack. </div>

Below are the two dates and times our community will gather to spam the network. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>January 24, 2018 @ 9pm GMT +0<br /><br />January 27, 2018 @ 9pm GMT +0</b></span></span><br /><br /><b>How do I join? </b><br /><br />Please head to our Testnet Page for clear instructions on how to participate. There you will find everything from downloading your first testnet wallet to importing public / private keys to even receiving your first test XBY. <br /><br />https://testnet.xtrabytes.global/<br /><br /><b>Where will the Xtrabytes community gather during the event?</b><br /><br />You can join our discord and head to our #testnet channel. There we will be chatting and sharing observations as the community spams the network.<br /><br />http://join.xtrabytes.chat/ &nbsp;<br /><br /><b>What should I expect?</b><br /><br />So far we have made much progress throughout the testing phases, taking a very systematic approach as to how we troubleshoot and fix things. Moving into this community phase is another milestone for the testnet, so it&#039;s extremely important that we reach out to anyone who can assist us in testing the boundaries of the network. &nbsp;<br /><br />Once the community strike is complete we will provide a detailed analysis of peak transactions per second in addition to the number of nodes operational at the time of the network spamming.<br /><br /><b>What if I’m having technical issues?</b><br /><br />There will be active tech support members on discord that will be ready to help with any issues that may arise during the testing. However, we still ask that any significant problems you encounter be reported by opening a ticket in our Help Center.<br />https://support.xtrabytes.global/<br /><br /><b>Can I watch the event live?</b><br /><br />Yes! You can see a live stream of the community spamming on Twitch: &nbsp;https://twitch.tv/reclusiarh &nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Closing:</b><br /><br />Once it&#039;s time to transition to mainnet, we want to rest assured that we received as much feedback as possible during the testnet, giving future investors confidence in the integrity of the XTRABYTES network. We are aware that many community members are getting restless, but we must reiterate how important it is for us to be diligent in testing before launching a service that practically knows no bounds. <br /><br />Alas, flex your social might and spread the word, we need you to facilitate a truly groundbreaking testnet!<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>January 24th - Results of first coordinated stress-test in testnet #3</b></span><br /><br /><br />XTRABYTES wants to thank all of the testnet #3 participants for their time and effort. We had a great time meeting many of you, chatting up a storm, and conducting a fantastic testnet. So let’s get right to the details!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Steps taken prior to testnet</b></span></span><br /><br />An important distinction must be made between our results from January 24th’s coordinated strike and Testnet #2 conducted last year. But before moving forward, let us explain the two options our developers were faced with before commencing the event:<br /><br /><i>Use the sendmany() command for transactions<br />Use the tools provided in the testnet wallet for transactions</i><br /><br />We wanted to stress-test our network, therefore the sendmany() command was not used. In short, sendmany() creates 1 transaction with however many addresses you insert as total outputs. This process was used in testnet #2. These outputs are still processed by the network as they deliver the specified amounts to the respective addresses, and are perceived as transactions in essence. However, this is effectively just a way to show high numbers without simulating a real-world environment. We have therefore opted to test using the tools instead. These numbers can unfortunately not be compared to testnet #2 as they are completely different. Therefore, we will use both the sendmany() and the tools on our next coordinated stress-test on Saturday, January 27th. Currently, there is a lot of confusion regarding these numbers and differences in transactions, and we hope to be able to give a clear insight on what the actual difference is in a separate article.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Details about the wallet &amp; the old chain</b></span></span><br /><br />Our current testnet wallet utilizes a lot of the Bitcoin clone code. This code is outdated with a lot of disadvantages, effectively not designed for high throughputs, as we have all witnessed. First, let us address a few basics:<br /><br />For the testwallet, a PoW factor (mining) was still implemented to have a healthy supply of circulating XBY. Aside from that, the old code was always relying on Proof-of-Work (PoW), these code parts have been removed and have been replaced by the Proof-of-Signature (PoSign) code. This means that no mining or staking process is needed and nodes can sign off on the transactions. Further details will become available with the patent. We are held back by this old code because it has severe limitations, most importantly:<br /><br />Block creation time: The block creation times in the old code are variable, with a minimum of 60 seconds per block. This value was implemented to prevent e.g. orphan blocks and chain splitting, acting as an additional security measurement.<br />The old code does not contain the core parts of the code, which are the VITALS and PULSE systems. This means that we are unable to ping the other nodes in the network to sign off on transactions, leading to slow block creations.<br />All transactions are stored in the wallet.dat file, causing a high amount of disk transactions and fragmentation of the wallet.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">Results from testnet</span></span></b><br /><br />The Bitcoin protocol runs at 2 - 7 transactions/second. By simply changing the code to run off the PoSign algorithm, we were able to increase these numbers to more than double, reaching more than 23 transactions/second, proving that the new algorithm is indeed more efficient than Bitcoin’s. This reassures us that the ability of the technology with all its components can indeed reach the desired tps figure of our marketed 10.000+ transactions/second. Remember that these numbers cannot be compared to our previous testnet, as we used different spamming tools. With this stress-test we have confirmed the limits of this old protocol, and it has provided us with more details to work with. <br /><br />For our second coordinated strike, we will utilize both tools available, starting with a sendmany(). After finishing round one we will once again use the provided tools to check a more real-life environment.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Closing</b></span></span><br /><br />Again, we want to send a massive thanks to the XTRABYTES community! We hope you (and your friends and family) will help us again for our next coordinated testnet event on:<br /><br /><b>Saturday, January 27th @ 21:00 GMT+0 </b><br /><br />Best,<br /><br />The XTRABYTES Team</div>

XTRABYTES is a long term project and we always have and always will ensure that we do what is best for the long term vision we have.<br /><br />During the last several days, I have met our patent lawyers on 2 separate occasions. The first meeting was January 17th and was intended to evaluate the law firm, which also offered them the opportunity to evaluate us. The second meeting was on the 23rd, when the initial tech discussions took place and the retainer was paid. <br /><br />The law firm (which we will not disclose) conducted initial research on the XTRABYTES project after our first meeting and during the second meeting revealed they are very happy to work with us on this patenting process. <br /><br />We did not get into full disclosure during the second meeting but upon providing basic details, the law firm was extremely impressed and excited to be working with us. Future meetings will include both Borzalom and CCRevolution and will include finalizing all the information the law firm needs in order to complete the patenting process, which will lead us to the highly discussed &quot;patent pending&quot; status. <br /><br />Please do not assume times and dates, nor is it practical to try to dictate how long this should be taking us. We always work within our available time frames and this also includes availability of the lawyers we are working with.<br /><br />Thank you all for your dedication and please continue to help the new community members gain a full understanding of the great things we are doing here at XTRABYTES Ltd.&nbsp; <br /><br />The XTRABYTES Team<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

Whether it be Bittrex or another one doesn&#039;t matter, but there are very good chances it goes much higher from here. Don&#039;t focus too much on this Bittrex listing. <br /></div><br />Other big exchanges will come after mainnet, mainnet will not come untill there is something done with patent. When is patent? Who knows? Days, Weeks, months, years?<br /></div><br />No one knows, everything should be true on a smooth and normal network so no constraints at launch.<br /></div><br />Few months is my guess. Last rounds of testing in progress, patent application in the works, it’s all coming together. I’m really not sure why this coin isn’t already a lot higher. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can only answer the first question&nbsp; :)<br /><br />The code is currently closed-source, they did recently open up the commits so people can see there is work being done (see couple of posts above). The intention is that the code can be open sourced after a patent has been granted. There have been initial conversations with patent lawyers and they identified 3 pieces of the technology that are unique enough to patent. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Relax, the market took a big hit with South Korea threatening to close down there cryptocoin exchanges, with them being about 17% or something like that of the market, it caused a huge sell off to happen as people pulled out of the market. Now that things are settling the money will start to return over the next few months.</div>

They then proceeded to remove 185,310 XBY....4109 XRP and 22 LTC<br /><br />Yes I was stupid enough not to have 2FA on my email or even my exchanges. I have been in crypto since 2014 and never been hacked, so I got very complacent and thought it couldn&#039;t happen to me.<br /><br />The Police have been notified and I will be visited by them on Saturday 3rd February to give full details of this fraud/theft.<br /><br /><br /><br />What I think has happened:<br /><br />1) Some pro&#039;s have got hold of my email address associated with bitcoin exchanges from the darkweb and hacked it, then tried their luck.<br /><br />2) Someone in Slack and Discord has seen me chatting about my funds + email and targeted me.<br /><br /><br /><br />I believe the latter has happened for the following reasons:<br /><br />I have mentioned briefly to people what exchanges I use and what amount I had in them.<br />I put my email out in slack (as was requested) to receive XFUEL in return for BTC donations I made.<br />The hacker seemed XBY specific. He attempted twice to get into my CEX account. Once on the night on the attack and again the following morning.<br />A few other non-XBY exchanges were unaffected.<br /><br /><br />For any bounty hunters who know this person, I will be very discrete and we can arrange a payment settlement after their identity has been revealed and consequent arrest and retrieval of funds.<br /><br />For anyone who think they can hunt him here are some details:<br /><br />My email hacks:<br /><br /><a href="http://i67.tinypic.com/9qjyja.jpg">http://i67.tinypic.com/9qjyja.jpg</a><br /><br /><a href="http://i65.tinypic.com/20sg1j.jpg">http://i65.tinypic.com/20sg1j.jpg</a><br /><br />My Bitstamp hack:<br /><br /><a href="http://i67.tinypic.com/2wdccue.jpg">http://i67.tinypic.com/2wdccue.jpg</a><br /><br />My Cryptopia hack:<br /><br /><a href="http://i67.tinypic.com/16gaeq9.jpg">http://i67.tinypic.com/16gaeq9.jpg</a><br /><br /><br />BTC TXID 438e7b8012bb5270a038959e47d26e4de2f4becf80e7fcc0c29f6c05bd0b1612&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WALLET 1JiurQJiUxTfv1A3Fc2xq8CQH5RYroW3g2<br /><br />BTC TXID ed36388d1f6584ca1833c67093bb7fbdc9973f50728c5203b2c24c98111d3225&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WALLET 1AcPpbq8uQsXfiGzqNNBZB5SSiyPCCaSnk<br /><br />XBY TXID 00af370549e3ceb0be2279c20ec47a1c79580826b5d2bf636f409c215c858b04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WALLET BJM3s8aKQiFZPUW4RdEpeErCwVrcbhkhLi<br /><br /><br />I would be very grateful for anyone who feels like dobbing in their &quot;friend&quot;.

Core code commits will become publicly available after we are granted the patent pending status. Anyone can view and contribute to the listed issues and tasks on github. Regular commits (weekly) are planned to happen. <br /><br />In other development news, we have added a new back-end developer to our X-CITE team and are actively looking for additional contributors.

With you showing open progress, it will demonstrate that XBY isn&#039;t growing solely based on speculation and hype. I&#039;ll invest a bit more now as well and keep an eye on this project...and PURE, if it ever comes to cryptopia ;D. </div>

Then you&#039;d really have to jump and get your coins out of there quickly. <br /><br />As for as updating the wallet to the current version?&nbsp; They are notoriously slow in doing so, if they decide to do it at all.<br /><br />Most of us know the risks with Yobit, and still some choose to trade there. I do on rare occasions now . . <br /><br />I hope you are able to move your coins off very soon. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div align="center"><a href="https://s10.postimg.org/r5vwc8mux/coordinated_stress_test_1500x500.png">https://s10.postimg.org/r5vwc8mux/coordinated_stress_test_1500x500.png</a></div><br /><br />After releasing the information regarding the first coordinated stress-test, we announced a second strike was to come. The second strike has now concluded and the results have been processed. This will be a short announcement, as everything what had to be said regarding the testnet was already stated in our first update, which can be found here:<br />https://community.xtrabytes.global/threads/results-from-the-coordinated-strike-1.531/<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Summary</b></span><br /><br />During our first coordinated strike we simulated real-world environments (individual transactions with one output) through our test-tools. During the second strike, sendmany() commands were spammed across the network to try and simulate as much traffic as possible with the relatively small number of participants (around 100 out of 512+ registered). Many people also encountered wallet errors, ran out of funds or had other problems, yet we still managed to reach a 5x increase in transaction speeds compared to the previous strike, reaching 107 tps.<br /><br />Please be aware that our new technology, including the new X-CITE wallet, is completely coded from scratch. Therefore, it will look and function completely different. This should resolve all the current issues we’re having with the wallets.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Further Analysis</b></span><br /><br />In our next steps we will analyze and process the hardware specifications from the systems used for the nodes and their performance. Public github commits (https://github.com/borzalom/xcite) are also released regarding the X-CITE client (you can also follow them on our discord channel #github). As an official reply to address a concern some people have regarding the patent: we are not held back by the patent, there is plenty of development going on in the background ensuring that a high quality product can be delivered.<br /><br />Last but not least, Borzalom has compiled a new testnet wallet containing extra code that requires testing. We plan to test the limits of the PoSign algorithm once more by adjusting the block parameters, with block sizes being increased to 50 MB and block times being reduced to a minimum of 6 seconds. Therefore, testnet #3 will be extended. Details for a coordinated effort will follow. The testnet block explorer and the respective transactions per second can be found at: http://xcite.xtrabytes.services/. Blocks with over 500 tps have already been registered, even though this wasn’t through an official coordinated stress-test.<br /><br />As a general remark regarding which hardware specifications are best to produce high tps, it is a combination of the CPU, disk performance (SSD being obviously better than a HDD) and the chain acceptance speed. The wallet occasionally freezes due to the old chain, but will be improved with the upcoming testnet wallet.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The Next Steps</b></span><br /><br />We are aiming to have two additional Coordinated Strikes at different dates and times to accommodate for global time differences using the newest wallet (version 5), which can be found at the following link by Monday, February 5th:<br /><br />https://testnet.xtrabytes.global/<br /><br />Please download and test it beforehand to ensure smooth operation during the actual stress-test events, which are scheduled for:<br /><br /><b>February 7th @ 9PM Eastern Standard Time (For USA Participants)<br /><br />February 8th @ 9PM GMT +0 (For EU Participants)</b><br /><br />This will hopefully be the last coordinated strike we do on our old chain before moving over to the new and improved Zoltchain.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Closing</b></span><br /><br />We would like to thank all the participants again for helping XTRABYTES with our testnet. The intel gathered from these testnets is invaluable in order to create a solid product.<br /><br />https://community.xtrabytes.global/threads/results-of-coordinated-strike-2-and-whats-to-come.552/</div>

After digging through the issue we discovered that one of our Virtual Private Servers had hit a &#039;full disk&#039; error and was halting the network. This error can be attributed to the old chain relying on servers to accomplish block generations. To solve the issue, our developers provided additional space to the VPS thus enabling the network to synchronize and go live without any further issues.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been thinking about this whole patent thing, and I wonder if it is really necessary at all.&nbsp; When dealing with decentralized systems, what can a patent really protect?&nbsp; For instance if some anon developer forks the XBY code and creates his own project, there is really no way to shut it down.&nbsp; It would be as futile as the media companies who have been trying to shut down bittorrent.&nbsp; <br /><br />Who is there even to sue in a decentralized platform?

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When they registered as business for tax purposes I think a default part of that or at least an option was I think some shares given out. Its really a non story. I know many other blockchain companies do the same like EOS which is registered as a business I think in the cayman islands. There may be needed a discussion how the shares are given out or not as the case may be but I don&#039;t see it as an issue. Probably the best would be node owners own the shares and maybe Borz and CCREv also own a chunk. I can assure you most blockchain companies are registered and probably don&#039;t even think to give shares out and keep them all. Honestly in a decentralised system A share won&#039;t I think give any income to anyone. &nbsp;Maybe it will have relevance in area of direction of the company which might be an issue in the future with say a bigger company wanting to &#039;buy&#039; xtrabytes or fork or something. <br /><br /><br />As always the community manages to go off on tangents on secondary issues that don&#039;t really matter. And if some later discussion is needed to how shares will work and be owned etc it will get sorted later. For now....meh...boring.<br /><br /><br />Registering was ultimately about protecting Xtrabytes and that also means us as investors so.....and I would gladly take a bit of legal centralised power over being fucked by any one who wants to clone XBY and stick Google or some other company name on it. </div>

I think we will see impatience with the new buyers from the 600 area start to market dump while other coins are pumping to chase them so&nbsp; it wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea setting some stink bids.<br /><br />Not sure how long the patent filing will take I believe the hard part is having the lawyers understand the tech and what is being patented. They will have to do their research as well&nbsp; and create a draft for filing, imo I&#039;d say 3-6 months for pending status. I&#039;m probably wrong though, sure lawyers here would know alot more.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Update on Cryptopia:<br /><br />https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/News<br /><br />Message from CEO Alan Booth<br />Dear Valued Cryptopians<br /><br /><i>I am privileged to have been appointed by the Board as the first CEO of Cryptopia Ltd. Whilst this is an incredibly exciting opportunity to head up a leading cryptocurrency exchange and an innovator in the Fintech sector, I am aware that there are a number of very urgent priorities to address to ensure greater customer satisfaction and trust.<br /><br />Cryptopia has experienced incredibly fast growth (last quarter our user base grew by an astounding 940%) and as with any company expanding at this pace, we have faced many challenges associated with this growth. My commitment to you, our customer, is that our team will be 100% focussed on the short term urgent priorities of faster support response times, improved user experience and enhanced transparency and security.<br /><br />We acknowledge those that are suffering due to extended delays around support response times and I do understand the frustration. We apologise that you have experienced these issues and I guarantee that this will dramatically improve as we increase resource and attention in this area.<br /><br />Please ensure that you continue to lodge support queries through the appropriate channel. It also helps the team to close resolved tickets so they can prioritise. Directly contacting the team via social media channels won’t lead to a faster resolution and we ask for your patience as we improve our systems and processes in this area. Remember, I have only just arrived and the changes we make are for the good of all and will lead to the fastest resolution of all outstanding issues.<br /><br />My experience in working with tech start-ups demonstrates I am well placed to drive Cryptopia forward and under my leadership, Cryptopia will continue to evolve from a counter-culture start-up into a global player in the Fintech industry.<br /><br />Rest assured there are no more excuses – the team here are truly dedicated and focused on delivering a fast, secure and customer focussed cryptocurrency exchange. And we are here for the long game.<br /><br />You have my commitment to make weekly updates across all media and we will be honest and diligent in our dealings with you.<br /><br />Best wishes<br />Alan Booth</i></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>CCR blog repost</b>: (from https://blog.xtrabytes.global/additional-features/state-of-the-byte/)<br /><br />&quot;Before getting started, I want to thank the XTRABYTES community for their patience during these past several weeks. I have recently met with the XTRABYTES managers and a few other key members of our team to define future developments and organize various details as we continue to move forward.<br /><br />On that note, I think it is crucial to reiterate the amazing job our teams are doing. The work happening behind the scenes on all levels, as well as on the front lines, is very encouraging and exciting. Several teams are being streamlined and plans to bring on more people are in the works (more below). Several new development teams will be created for various aspects of the XTRABYTES project and although we will not be ready to move on many fronts until after the patent applications are completed, I think that now is a very good time for anyone interested in helping to let it be known to our management staff.<br /><br />To understand this, we also must look at our usage of XFUEL. To find the most up to date information regarding XFUEL, please visit our Knowledge Base article. In summary, XFUEL was created to fund the development of XTRABYTES. We cannot support the kind of team we require without paying people something for their time and efforts. People have bills to pay and even though they may be totally in love with what we are doing and want to be part of the project, a steady income stream for our team members remains a priority.<br /><br />Today, we have a healthy development budget which grows as our price climbs over the long term. We are also able to pay our people fair salaries, so that they are able to give the 110% that we wish to see from them.<br /><br />Why is this important?<br />Because XTRABYTES is not just another coin. We are a platform with intentions to become an industry giant. Many of you may feel this is a pipe dream, but let’s take a look at why we feel this is where we are heading.<br /><br />Unprecedented Security<br /><br />Centralized systems and blockchains are vulnerable to attack. XTRABYTES is establishing the technology to be far superior in this regard and prohibit those vulnerabilities.<br /><br />Unparalleled Speed<br /><br />We will not bother to post our “true” target tps speed, but we will let you know we are patenting our method for this also. &nbsp;We believe we will be the new benchmark that few if any other crypto companies will be able to reach until they develop a better method.<br /><br />DICOM<br /><br />As most people know, our Distributed Command Module will allow all developers to attach their project directly to the XTRABYTES platform. This means we have the potential for quick growth with many of the projects already in existence and those yet to be created.<br /><br />Economic &amp; Eco Incentive<br /><br />The XTRABYTES protocol does not depend on heavy mining thus reducing the power needs for the blockchain to function properly. This means users will save in the long-term for their computing power and will be responsible for a more eco-friendly solution.<br /><br />Patent Protection<br />This is being done to prevent the following: useless clones that result in people losing money to failed projects, improper/unethical use of our tech and most importantly for the long term development of XTRABYTES, the prevention of developmental brains branching off to different projects that effectively reduces the overall quality of the tech.<br /><br />In other words, we want to keep everyone on the same team and focused on the greater good of the technology being developed here at XTRABYTES. That technology being best described as a supercomputer on distributed ledger.<br /><br />Adding to these points, we would like to confirm that XTRABYTES Ltd. will be filing (4) patents. Further detail on the specifics can not be shared at this moment but rest assured we will be posting that information as soon as we can.<br /><br />Even further…<br />By registering our patents we can begin sharing some of the code and technical details/information with our core developers so they can begin to contribute and take the massive load off the shoulders of Borzalom. Until that happens, we are absolutely obligated by our patent law firm to keep our tech secret. However, this does not mean that we can’t begin looking for those developers to join our team for when the tech is ready for collaborated development and completion. By pre-selecting developers (who have signed an NDA with XTRABYTES Ltd.) we will be accomplishing two things. First, it will establish relations with vetted developers that will be on the front lines of our tech, and secondly, it will position us to begin a more collaborative effort the minute we enter a patent pending status.<br /><br />Development Team Expansion<br /><br />As many of you know, Borzalom and myself have always maintained our desire for privacy and our lack of desire to be the face of XTRABYTES. Neither of us are properly qualified or comfortable for the front facing role of CEO, to be on stage at events, to be on television/video for promotions and interviews, or to meet with other high level corporate leaders for the various upcoming growth and partnership challenges we will face.<br /><br />As such, I would like to formally announce that we will begin our search for the first CEO of XTRABYTES Ltd. This person will play a top management role for XTRABYTES, filling the aforementioned requirements, along with all other general duties of a CEO. As this role is of utmost importance, we do not have a date for when it has to be filled. We will begin the search and will keep the community updated as we close in on a final candidate.<br /><br />C-CEX Exchange<br /><br />After contacting the owner of C-CEX, CCRevolution was able to bring down the withdrawal fee from 50 XBY to 2 XBY. For anyone looking to withdraw XBY please know this has been improved and is ready to go.<br /><br />One Year Anniversary<br /><br />On a last note, April 7th will be the official anniversary of XTRABYTES (the day when C-CEX accepted our version of the XBY chain). I would like to state that we HOPE HOPE HOPE to have our patents registered by early-mid April. This is our target and we will do our best to meet this timeframe.<br /><br />Thank you again for all the support thus far, <br />CCRevolution&quot;<br /><br />https://blog.xtrabytes.global/additional-features/state-of-the-byte/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In my opinion, the XTRABYTES project has very good potential for growth. First, XTRABYTES solves the main problem of blocking - scaling. Thanks to this integration of XTRABYTES into projects from the real sector. Secondly, in the near future, the team plans to refine its functionality and increase its user base.<br />If you are considering coins XTRABYTES for investment purposes, then count on a long-term placement of your funds.</div>

Although with the 1M fuel bounty to find major flaws, haven&#039;t see anyone post anything at all. Not sure but I don&#039;t think anyone in the crypto community is interested in fuel that currently has no exchange or value. Try throwing 100,000$ bounty in BTC that would draw attention.<br /><br />Still closed source of core code, new protocol there has to be a security audit no one is going to just trust a closed source protocol. Exchanges won&#039;t either, they want to inspect the code to ensure there&#039;s no backdoors or shady shit in it (ppl learned from 2013-2014).<br /><br />Are we becoming like Ripple? ???</div>

Welcome to the community. <br /><br />Our ANN has a ton of information, but we have some other areas that might interest you to read.<br /><br />Our blog: https://blog.xtrabytes.global/ &nbsp;has a ton of interesting articles that further explain XBY. <br /><br />Our zendesk has some FAQ&#039;s and guides as well: https://support.xtrabytes.global/<br /><br />We are currently working on getting patent pending status for a few pieces of our technology. <br /><br />If you use Discord, join us there: https://discord.xtrabytes.global/ &nbsp;<br /><br />Or ask questions here, and we will do our best to answer them. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2725299.msg32130256#msg32130256">Quote from: Delphinus on March 12, 2018, 10:55:27 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2725299.msg32093040#msg32093040">Quote from: CCNCCN on March 11, 2018, 08:21:28 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I think this is important information I wasn&#039;t totally aware of:<br /><br />https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/398491929303711744/421267302684819458/2018-03-08_14.25.33.png <br /><br /><br />The project will not release all code, which is not inline with my understanding of the previous statements.<br /></div><br />Can you post the context as well?

One of the great things about Discord, is that convo history never gets lost like it does in Slack without a paid plan.<br /><br />The code will be audited. NDA&#039;s are imperative. And to get on certain major exchanges, an audit is also necessary. CCR clearly isn&#039;t a lawyer and that&#039;s exactly why we need legal counsel for these matters. <br /><br />This was the next few lines of conversation. In the end, I can appreciate his honesty because he admits he does not know the legal end of things.<br /><br />https://s10.postimg.org/w6q8p34yh/image.png</div>

Thank you for your understanding. <br /><br /><br /><br />Just a quick statement:<br /><br />The last couple of months have been amazing for XTRABYTES, the growth we have experienced, the community we have built up around us and the progress we have made on our development front are amazing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at this time in the evolution of XTRABYTES there are also some downsides and there are people who are somehow not happy with us entering the market, therefore it is very important for us to distance ourselves from the statements being made which contain fake news and misinformation. <br /><br />We regret that people feel the need to try to bring us down with photoshopped screenshots and fake statements. Sadly, this is part of what gives crypto a bad name out in the world and these people think they are hurting XTRABYTES, but in fact, they are hurting all of crypto.<br /><br />I want to close this message by thanking all the people who are supporting us on a daily basis and also those who work hard for the benefit of XTRABYTES. All these people are extremely important for us and will always be among the first movers of this great evolution. <br /><br />Thanks again everybody!<br /><br />Stay Strong!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />Please note that you can find us on Discord at: https://discord.xtrabytes.global/<br />Also, our website is located at: http://xtrabytes.global<br /><br /><br /></div>
