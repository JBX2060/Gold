Presumably those who only committed to SourceForge no longer had commit access after the move</li><li>[2] Sirius was the one who created the original SVN repo on SourceForge.</li><li>[3] Gavin was the Lead Maintainer from 2/23/11 (https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/27102906/) until 4/7/14 (https://bitcoinfoundation.org/bitcoin-core-maintainer-wladimir-van-der-laan/)</li><li><del>[4] I cannot find anything that suggests that Jeff Garzik has given up his commit access or has had it revoked</del> I was informed via IRC PM by some of the Core devs that Jeff&#039;s commit access was revoked some time around August 2016 after several months of inactivity.</li><li>[5] Wladimir is the current Lead Maintainer. After participating in that role for a long time, he was officially given the position by Gavin on 4/7/14 (https://bitcoinfoundation.org/bitcoin-core-maintainer-wladimir-van-der-laan/)</li><li>[6] Jonas is currently the GUI Maintainer. After participating in that role for a long time, he was officially given the position by Wladimir on 11/13/15 (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-November/011728.html)</li><li>[7] Marco is currently the QA/Testing Maintainer.

He had been contributing for a while, particularly to wallet related things. When laanwj asked if anyone would like to be the role of Wallet Maintainer, MeshCollider volunteered.</li><li>[9] fanquake is currently the Build System Maintainer as well as a general maintainer. He had been contributing for a while, particularly with updating dependency versions and build system related things. He also had been doing a lot of janitorial things in the repo such as tagging issues, closing old issues and PRs, nominating things to be merged, etc. At the CoreDev event in Amsterdam which several maintainers and contributors attended, he was nominated to be a maintainer by the entire group.</li></ul><br />Other Notes: <br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Dates are Month/Day/year</li><li>There may be people missing and dates may be slightly incorrect. These are all that I can determine by looking at old emails and the commit history. Please let me know if anything is incorrect</li><li>The start date is determined by the first merge commit made by that person. The end date is determined by the date of the last merge commit made by that person or other announcements of commit access revocation.</li><li>Those who still actively and frequently contribute are in bold</li></ul><br /><hr /><br />After scrolling through nearly the entire git merges history, I have found a couple of interesting things. <br /><br />Satoshi did not use a Version Control System originally. The releases and source code were originally in a rar file that was uploaded to bitcoin.org. Sirius had to setup the original SVN repository on SourceForge for him. This was then later migrated to GitHub by Gavin. Originally patches were authored by developers and then emailed to Satoshi, Sirius, or Gavin who then committed the changes to the source tree with the commit message containing the attribution, but not the actual commit itself.<br /><br />Another interesting fact is that the giving out of commit access has become more strict. It is now a privilege held by those given maintainer positions and those whose privilege was grandfathered in (i.e. they had it previously and kept it). Previously it was simply given out to those who contributed frequently and revoked after they stopped contributing. This appears to be no longer the case, although there are still multiple people who can commit to the repository so that there is not any reliance on one person. The maintainers are still given to frequent contributors as the maintainers are frequent contributors to the set of functionality for which they are maintainers of. They received the positions because of frequent contributions to those functionalities.<br /><br />Lastly, I could not find any evidence for Satoshi ever publicly announcing that Gavin was to be the Lead Maintainer after him. It seems that Gavin was already a frequent contributor and already had commit access for a while before Satoshi disappeared. After Satoshi disappeared and Sirius stopped contributing as much, Gavin simply took over the role as lead maintainer as he was the only frequent contributor with commit access.<br /><br /><hr /><br />Edits: This has been posted to reddit where the people on this list are more active (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5riy1j/list_of_people_who_have_had_commit_access_to/).<br />Dooglus -&gt; dooglus<br />Jeff&#039;s commit access was revoked a while ago<br />Bolded active contributors<br />Clarified how maintainers got their roles</div>

Now, if you are a frequent contributor to a specific set of functionality, you become the maintainer for that stuff and get commit access. But still, it is for being a frequent contributor.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Presumably you discovered this when you asked the question to every person who has generated a key for someone else? In other words, you can&#039;t really do anything except make a prosaic supposition, the real intentions are not really knowable information.</div>
