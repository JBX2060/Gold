Mining LTC is now more profitable than mining BTC.<br /></div><br />I&#039;ve talked about it before, GPU are not going to disappear. Many people have the magic thinking that because ASIC are coming, GPU are out of the market. But &quot;out of the market&quot; means dismantling the farm and trying to sell all that equipment. I don&#039;t want to do that, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the goal of a lot of people. Gamers who were making a little side money mining with their stock still want to make a little money. Those GPU are still on the surface of the planet, and their owners still want to use them. <br /><br />Litecoin is a way to continue this. Some wealth is moving from BTC to LTC, and probably that people are anticipating the transfer when ASIC will hit. Also, there&#039;s the whole unexplored market of having TWO legit blockchains that was impossible when only Bitcoin was around. <br /><br />Miners will bring wealth to Litecoin and give it value the same way they brought wealth to Bitcoin and gave it value.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117962.msg1266310#msg1266310">Quote from: notme on October 12, 2012, 12:57:36 AM</a></div><div class="quote">What I don&#039;t get is how litecoins are worth more than namecoins.<br /></div><br />Litecoin is doing its job well, being a &quot;cheap and less secure Bitcoin&quot;. Namecoin is not interesting to use, too complex, lack details and guidelines and people simply don&#039;t bother. Merged mining hurt its value too, since people are not interested, they just receive this bonus that they sell for BTC. <br /><br />I like the idea behind Namecoin, don&#039;t misunderstand me. But it&#039;s so....useless right now, even Bitcoin services don&#039;t seem to find a use for Namecoins. Where is the GUI? Where is the simple website that hold my hand about how to use it?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117962.msg1266578#msg1266578">Quote from: goxed on October 12, 2012, 04:13:05 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Cool :) But to mine LTC, I have to stop mining BTC.<br /></div><br />This quote explains why Litecoin is gaining value.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah as mine-and-dump coins go, litecoin is dojng okay, apart from bitcoins they and namecoins are the most valuable mine-and-dump coins most of the time (actually maybe all the time).<br /><br />Take a look at http://galaxies.mygamesonline.org/digitalisassets.html to see how a bunch of other types of coin are doing, there are some surprises there I think.<br /><br />Basically it kind of looks like mine-and-dump might not be the greatest way of creating valuable currency.<br /><br />-MarkM-<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A rise in litecoin price could be a rational response to expected ASIC deployment (though the effect seems too big?).<br /><br />Investments in assets yielding litecoin and bitcion generate an incentive for complementary investments in litecoin and bitcoin applications. If ASICS make GPUs useless for producing bitcoin, then incentives for GPU owners to develop litecoin applications will be strengthened (i.e. efforts at bitcoin development will be diverted to litecoin). Essentially GPU owners will want to rescue their equipment from obsolescence.<br /><br />Improvements in litecoin applications would increase demand for litecoin, positively affecting price.<br /><br />Note that this only affects currencies that this should only affect currencies that can be mined with GPUs, but not with ASICs.<br /><br />[Note: This is not investment advice. The price rise seems larger than could be justified to me.]</div>

The number of miners doesn&#039;t change anything about the supply. And if it&#039;s not profitable anymore, the miners with the higher cost will drop, reducing the difficulty and making mining more profitable for those who stay. <br /><br />I was there when the same scenario happened with Bitcoin last year after the bubble. The same questions arised. What happened is that after the big boom of 30$ where tons of miners came to mine, miners dropped slowly but constantly as the price dropped down to 2$. The only miners still mining on November were people like me who have low electricity cost. We were not making a lot of money, but we were making a ton of Bitcoin that compensated for the lack of value of Bitcoin. <br /><br />The value is relative and is not that important for the survival of Litecoin. What is important is how many different people move Litecoin. The more there is people, the better it is for the currency. More miners means a better diversification of Litecoin, and that&#039;s always a good thing. </div>

Anybody can see this from the graphs.&nbsp; The LTC graphs show many cycles of pump/dump, candle sticks help to show this over 6 months, especially with volume metrics.&nbsp; This is nothing to do with &quot;currency finding it&#039;s fair openning price&quot;. <br /><br />Maybe you should correlate trends of up and down vs volume on LTC.&nbsp; I&#039;ll rung some technical analysis later for you, ignoring the original price adjustment/settlement to trading, you&#039;d have to be crazy to call a PoS currency, especially PPC a pump and dump. <br /><br />Anyway my bet stands as above, it&#039;ll be to 0.005 within no time. <br /><br /><br /></div>

It works similar to my &nbsp;namecoin and litecoin exchanges.

PPC released with an incomplete white paper that comes along after launch.<br />2. Huge amounts of PPC mined (30%+ mined in 5 days total (to-date) supply))<br />3. Sunny&#039;s trolls like AndyRossy and Server etc come out to defend Sunny as soon as he is caught in a tight spot claiming $100-$200k development time has gone into PPC to date and that Bitcoin&#039;s development is only about $500k worth.<br />4. PPC bitparking exchange price spikes to 0.001btc then back to 0.0001btc and AndyRossy claims that isn&#039;t a pump and dump (at all).<br /><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>5. Mr. Sunny Drag Queen admits he doesn&#039;t even have a formula or mathematical analysis of how PPC should work.</b></span><br />6. Difficulty on the block explorer shows erratic jumps in difficulty from like 1.18 to 10,000 every few blocks. No real pattern here it seems. Reminds me of &quot;trust nodes&quot; that get to mine every other block etc.<br />7. Sunny also admits that much less than 50% of total PPC is needed to manipulate the network (what number? he doesn&#039;t even know).<br /><br /></b><br /></div><br />Oh another subject change, yes LTC is a pump and dump..... oh wait, no, PPC is, oh wait, sunny king has lots of coin, oh wait.... maybe ppc is just.<br /><br />Last answer / reply for you in here, you&#039;re wasting my time.<br /><br />1) You&#039;ve not even read the white paper, I doubt you even understand it.<br />2) Correct, and, as you point out, this diminishes over time, the total PPC&#039;s out there is over 10m now.<br />3) 100-200k is fair; and as to the above point, im happy to reward the lead dev for doing a good job. &nbsp;He doesnt have &quot;over 30%+&quot;, but im sure he has, and he should, hold some of the currency. &nbsp;It&#039;s a working incentive. <br />4) This has been answered before, like LTC in early days, it&#039;s price stability, you&#039;ve not addressed the flat line since, over the last month. LTC charts shows its a cycle of pump/dump, nothing more. Some people like this. <br /><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>5) This is inaccurate, and ties to your point 7. </b></span>&nbsp;<br />6) See point 1, this made me laugh btw.<br />7) Maybe you can solve / map this, it&#039;s not a trivial problem. <br /><br />Andy<br /><br /><br /></div><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 16pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>So again please explain to me how point 5 is inaccurate... lol</b></span><br />&nbsp;:D :D :D :D ;D ;D ;D ;D<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=101954.msg1272197#msg1272197">Quote from: Sunny King on October 14, 2012, 08:18:33 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><span style="font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>You are right I don&#039;t have a math analysis of how much coins are needed to attempt control of block chain. </b></span>First it&#039;s more difficult than Satoshi&#039;s design, secondly I think there maybe other practical attacking vectors that I have missed so putting a math formula there as the final say on security is a bit misleading as well. So no I don&#039;t think I am ready to do this type of analysis. I think I have mentioned this before.<br /><br />I did not claim that you need 50% coins to control ppcoin block chain. Much less of that would be enough.<br /><br />It may not match your expectations but I did what I can to contribute, rather than sitting there and accusing other people being lazy and greedy while they are the ones doing the real work. How convenient.<br /><br />If you are so helpful then why don&#039;t you polish your analysis and continue discussion on the security properties? Instead you would just launch your personal crusade to attack me and ppcoin project. If you worried so much about investors then why I haven&#039;t seen one pm from you describing the vulnerability of ppcoin and discuss with me ways of fixing it? I have received quite a number of pms but none are from the detractors as their main goal is to discredit ppcoin in public.<br /><br />However given all that I have endured from you, you are still welcome to pm me if you truly wish to discuss about security analysis of ppcoin. Otherwise we would just have to part our ways.<br /></div></div>

The number of miners doesn&#039;t change anything about the supply. And if it&#039;s not profitable anymore, the miners with the higher cost will drop, reducing the difficulty and making mining more profitable for those who stay. <br /><br />I was there when the same scenario happened with Bitcoin last year after the bubble. The same questions arised. What happened is that after the big boom of 30$ where tons of miners came to mine, miners dropped slowly but constantly as the price dropped down to 2$. The only miners still mining on November were people like me who have low electricity cost. We were not making a lot of money, but we were making a ton of Bitcoin that compensated for the lack of value of Bitcoin. <br /><br />The value is relative and is not that important for the survival of Litecoin. What is important is how many different people move Litecoin. The more there is people, the better it is for the currency. More miners means a better diversification of Litecoin, and that&#039;s always a good thing. <br /></div>I think you missed my point.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with miners reaching equilibrium with difficulty and earnings.&nbsp; My point is that the price of LTC won&#039;t go anywhere if it serves no purpose other than converting into another currency. <br /><br />The contrast with Bitcoin was that there were investors, markets where you could spend them, hoarders, and value other than exchanging for cash.&nbsp; If Bitcoin was only being sold into cash last year, it would be dead today..&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys,<br /><br />This topic is about Litecoin. I don&#039;t give a f**k about PPcoin. There is other topic for that, discuss that matter elsewhere. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117962.msg1274023#msg1274023">Quote from: BitBlitz on October 15, 2012, 05:54:41 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I think you missed my point.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with miners reaching equilibrium with difficulty and earnings.&nbsp; My point is that the price of LTC won&#039;t go anywhere if it serves no purpose other than converting into another currency. <br /><br />The contrast with Bitcoin was that there were investors, markets where you could spend them, hoarders, and value other than exchanging for cash.&nbsp; If Bitcoin was only being sold into cash last year, it would be dead today..&nbsp; <br /></div><br />Well, first, the price of Litecoin is between 6 and 9 cents. Last time Bitcoin was at that price, there was not a lot of investors or markets either. I know I&#039;m acting like a little girl with my topic, but I&#039;m realist enough to see that Litecoin is still valued very low. Currently, the value of Litecoin is around 0.007% of the price of Bitcoin. We can consider the market of Litecoin is also around 0.007% of what Bitcoin is. <br /><br />I know the market needs to be build, but it takes time. There&#039;s interesting opportunities for having two legit blockchains. I already have a couple of ideas of projects that could be done using two blockchains. As an alt-currency, in one year, Litecoin has already made a lot of accomplishments when you compare to other alt-currency. <br /><br />What you said has been said many times of Bitcoin since I&#039;ve been around. Bitcoin is still here because people found things to do with it. I&#039;m confident it will be the same thing for Litecoin. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">its interesting how LTC separated itself from BTC.&nbsp; While bitcoin dropped to even 8,x$&nbsp; &nbsp;LTC remained at roughly 0,074 $.<br />Now when BTC went back up, LTC doesnt follow.<br /><br />This shows it has got separated trading, it stands by itself.<br />Bitcoin is master no more :)<br /><br />cheers</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>Euronews, 1 April 2013:</b><br /><br />THE European Commission today announced a new directive to help combat the exchange rate volatility, believed primarily to be influenced by the financial and debt crises across the eurozone and worldwide. In particular, financial regulators have been concerned by the rapid changes in the exchange price of popular cryptocurrency Litecoin (LTC), and thus, in accordance with the long-standing EU principles of legislating, regulating, taxing and subsidizing anything that dares to live or move, and much besides that, the new directive will peg the Litecoin to Bitcoin exchange rate at 30,7789 LTC = <span class="BTC">BTC</span>1. All member states will be expected to enforce this directive within two years, forcing all exchanges operating within EU territory to trade at this fixed exchange price. Other pegs, including LTC/euro and BTC/euro may also be in the pipeline. Financial gurus and czars in the EU institutions and many member states believe these new rules will help fix the financial crisis.<br /><br />;D</div>
