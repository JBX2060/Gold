					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey folks,<br /><br />Join our BQC/BBQCoin Server with latest MPOS, a modified (stratum enabled) BBQCoind which will soon be released to the public and stratum-mining.<br /><br />The Server currently support:<br /><br />* Stratum Protocol<br />* Vardiff<br />* Optional Getwork Protocol<br />* Proportional Payout (NOT PPLNS!)<br />* Instant Cashout / Automatic Payout <br />* Idle Worker Notifs<br />* Many Statistics<br />* Optimized Version for Mobile Phones (try to access the site with your mobile!)<br />... and much more<br /><br />There is currently a very small 1% fee but everything else is completely free.<br /><br />Feel free to join the pool and please give me feedback in this thread or via PM, there are already a few kH/s running on the server, blocks are found, payouts are working etc.. So everything should be fine.<br /><br />You can access the pool via:<br /><br /><b>https://www.bbqpool.net</b><br /><br /><br />You can start mining by simply pointer cgminer i.e. to:<br />cgminer --scrypt -u username.worker -p workerpassword stratum+tcp://bbqpool.net:3333 &nbsp;<br /><br />or if you prefer the old getwork protocol (which you shouldn&#039;t)<br />cgminer --scrypt -u username.worker -p workerpassword bbqpool.net:8446<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for your note, I&#039;ve changed the thread title to reflect both.<br /><br />Pool is running good so far, currently @ around 30.000 kH/s, my load is still very low, would need some more kH/s to test how far we can push it, stratum really helps a lot.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had a small flaw in the hash rate detection which was off for around 200 kh/s for all users. That means that you were NOT credited too low, every user had a lower hash rate that means that every users still hat the same proportional amount on the block.<br /><br />So payouts were correct all the time.<br /><br />Pool is now hovering around 100.000 kh/s, I&#039;ve made some tweaks to the bbqcoind getwork code and the stratum var diff code, everything runs nicely and server load is around 15-20%, so if you got some more gpu&#039;s, point them to the pool :))<br /><br />I will begin migrating my ltc pool to the same codebase on a new server, so stay tuned for a new ltc pool very soon.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ah so your email support is also not working or neglected<br />So there is an additional problem on top of the missing transaction payouts.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry <br />I thought the neglect purposeful.<br />I have had so many problems with pools my patience has been stretched such that my temper voices hostility prematurely perhaps<br />Please excuse the frustration I was actually rather happy to find your pool and found it otherwise worthwhile after problems with other BBQ pools.<br />I had hoped to make your pool my Pool of choice for BBQcoins until I failed to receive the TX.<br /><br />The amount is not large and I knew it should not be difficult to have the tx cancelled and re-sent. Or resolved somehow.<br />It was mostly the lack of response from the support that enraged me.<br /><br />I will thank you to check your payout TX for two instances yet confirmed from the 7/8th of Feb. due to BBQPhilo bKjCsquagm5NaYRE5bzv1Ybns5y6nfntCD<br />I&#039;m pretty sure of the dates but the TX record no longer displays that far back.<br />Yes I had auto-payout set to 200. <br />If I remember correctly each TX should be just over 200. or perhaps 2 tx of 100 each<br />To be honest I have forgotten exactly and was prepared to write them of as I have had to do so many times before.<br /><br />I did see the TX listed but they never arrived...I waited 48 hours before sending the first email to support.<br />Of course I had the wallet open/running true in sync.<br />It was the first time using the pool and they should have been the first payouts..strange that I did receive some later payouts<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">FYI I had 9.5Mh/s on your pool and the var diff seems to kill my has hash rate as it climbs 32/64/128 etc.<br />My rates also fluctuated greatly from as low as 3.6/4.6 OFTEN to a RARE high spike of 10-11Mh/s<br />I think the pool total peaked near 30Mh/s again if memory serves.<br />And I found the refresh rate a little slow and too infrequent. The query rate also spiked high a few times<br />I have great ISP service and usually never have latency problems<br />A time stamp would be helpful to know the delay on the pool reports..<br />And of course the Diff is always wrong and behind by a block.<br /><br />Again I still found your pool much better than some others and will return if we can resolve the payout problem.<br />And now that I know where to find attentive support<br /><br /></div>
