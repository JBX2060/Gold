					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Print a banknote-style paper wallet at bitaddress.org.&nbsp; Fund the address printed on it.<br /><br />Easiest way to redeem it is at blockchain.info.&nbsp; You can import QR code privkeys directly though the webcam as they have a flash-based thing for doing it.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Blockchain.info has a &quot;send to email&quot; option.<br /><br />It creates a wallet for them and mails them a link explaining that they have been sent bitcoins. When they first click on the link they set their password and are in their wallet.</div>
