					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m sure people have noticed how eerily similar to religion Bitcoin is becoming. The mythical founder, the email disciples, the followers. This message board as a proto-bible of texts, the wiki and the churches efforts to consolidate a one-true-book. The false prophet of Real Solid, the breakway protestants of Litecoin and the cults of BBQ, IO,IX..... the small monastery of Dev coin. Our prayers to Satoshi in the form of mining- doing Satoshis&#039; work, The Charlaten of Pirate. And of course- the eternal blockchain. The collective memory of our entire universe.<br /><br /><br />So why doesn&#039;t someone just do it already- and register the Church of Satoshi? There is certainly enough philosophy here. <br /><br />eidt: Namecoin can be the lost 13th tribe of Alt Chains. </div>

Probably because all money have exchange value because people have a faith in it&#039;s value. And religion is a faith in the purest form.</div>

And considering Gavin is one of the original disciples, I guess he might be like Peter and once he&#039;s gone the next in line would be Pope. So you could join The Foundation I guess, they will give you some touch of Satoshi Divine. I donated to The Foundation at the outset, and thats a form a tithing. <br /><br />If you&#039;re up for LTC It&#039;s probably Coblee who needs to ordain you. Although unless he too disappears without a trace his earthly presence will dilute his power as people can directly disagree with him unlike &quot;Our Satoshi though art in Blockchain&quot;. <br /><br />Dunno- I guess it depends what CryptoChurch you want to be apart of. You could always form another fork and be your own Pope and make your own rules, ala &quot;RealSolid the false&quot; but you risk your followers being &#039;sock puppets&#039; for your heresy. </div>

Scientology is huge and powerful. Bitcoin has a far more philosophically sound background. The mathematics behind the cryptography in it&#039;s own right touches on the origins of the Universe in the sense that many enlightenment thinkers considered Mathematics some element of god.<br /><br />Indeed you are correct that the &#039;faith&#039; in the value of the currency reflects faith in a deity itself. <br /><br /></div>

Because it&#039;s crazy. And that would carry over with the real worlds impression of us as already being crazy. However it could be done anyway. Satoshi is gone, and I doubt even if he could prove himself (some message in the block chain?) many people would not care and would prefer the mythical Satoshi (Which if he is still alive, i suspect he is aware of himself).<br /><br /></div>

But he might never do so- indeed even signing something with the original genesis block (GOTTA love that it&#039;s not called &quot;the first block&quot; but Genesis.) doesn&#039;t prove its really him. I think conspiracy theorists would be the first to point out if the government did away with him a long time ago the would have also most likely confiscated his computer equipment and have access to his original keys. <br /><br />You don&#039;t appreciate how deep someone could get into this if they wanted to? Silliness aside, and no offence towards Mormons intended: But Mormonism started with an angel bringing invisible golden tablets to some guy in upstate New York and has since become one of the worlds fastest growing religions. The golden tablet episode happend already well within the reign of reason and science, so it&#039;s not like people can&#039;t still be swayed into believing in something that sounds at first: outright crazy. </div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I see a market for payment apps for churches. Churches are usually supported by passing a collection basket around their church on sunday. The problem with this is that none of the congregation know exactly how much is collected and sometimes dishonest priests steal some of the collection, for their own profit.<br /><br />If, instead of that, the church were to pass round a QR code, then the parishioners would be able to see exactly how much was collected each sunday, by monitoring the payment address, thru some kind of church payment app. <br /><br />Matonis tweeted about a catholic church in New York that is accepting bitcoin donations<br />http://www.stjohnsgoshen.com/bitcoin<br /></div>

Oh, and we need more holidays. Getting to use one &quot;diversity holiday&quot; to miss work every four years for Halving Day just isn&#039;t gonna cut it. &nbsp;<br /><br />EDIT: Just thought of two more.<br />1. No church teaching against the use of intoxicants (let&#039;s face it, if we force a split with the Silk Road contingent, we&#039;re gonna end up on the losing side of that one).<br />2. No weird sex stuff (and of course, by that I mean that the church should be totally cool with weird sex stuff). </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The main difference between Bitcoin as a religion and normal religions is that Bitcoin is real, and it works. <br /><br />While one might say that I worship the blockchain, I can show you instantly that it does what it&#039;s supposed to do. I can prove the validity of the system. Normal religions have no such evidence, and rely on &quot;faith&quot; which is a euphemism for &quot;belief despite a lack of evidence.&quot;<br /><br />Bitcoin may be the first &quot;utility-based&quot; religion as opposed to being faith-based.</div>
