					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So I had some BTC on an older Windows computer with an old version of the BTC client, 0.3.x.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was crashing on me after a minute or so of being open, and I kept restarting it and finally sent all my BTC to an address of a wallet I had stored on another computer<br /><br />I closed the bitcoin client that was buggy/crashing on me right after sending the coins.&nbsp; &nbsp;I backed up the wallet.dat and moved it to a computer with a working (latest) version of the bitcoin client.&nbsp; It was fully synced up with the blockchain before overwriting the wallet.dat.&nbsp; When I launched the client it showed my transaction in the tx list but it was 0/confirmed, and still is (this is about a week after sending the coins).&nbsp; The balance is 0 so the coins are out there &#039;in limbo&#039; and blockchain.info doensn&#039;t have any record of the transaction and they never arrived at the destination<br /><br />what do?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">nevermind, it looks like it is now starting to get confirmations.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br />so I guess you shouldn&#039;t send BTC and immediately close the client or it might never start getting confirmed..?</div>
