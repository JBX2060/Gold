					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">GLBSE was a huge part of bitcoin usage, tons of bitcoin were deposited with them. Now they are gone, and once<br />users get their coin back, they have no where to put them, there are currently no viable GLBSE alternative.<br />Many user will likely to sell their coins for cash. The price has already crashed from $12 to $11, even when no<br />user has gotten their coin back yet, now imagine the price crash when the users get their coins back.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">And the usual FUD starts.<br /><br />As I see it, GLBSE is a minor part of the Bitcoin economy as a whole and can&#039;t and certainly will not affect any even-slightly-longer term trends in any way. In the short term it&#039;s a good excuse to spark a healthy correction though, that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />Thus far the only actual applications for GLBSE have been mining, loans, rarely anything else. Nefario had plans for other stuff but never got there. I&#039;ve been known to underestimate the effect of events though, so maybe I&#039;m wrong. Regardless, I see the closure of GLBSE as a smaller thing than Pirate and the market recovered very well from that, didn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Also, GLBSE does have an alternative called MPEX. That is afaik much more legitimate anyway, there are actually some requirements to get listed over there. GLBSE was a loose cannon and had no diversity, I never even registered. Hopefully something better comes in the future.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anyone who sells now is just playing into the hands of those who are forcing the market down to get cheap coins. &nbsp; Selling now is more risky than holding I think. &nbsp; There may be a bit further it can fall, but long term, aside from the government making an announcement that they are actively going to go after bitcoin, there is only one direction to go.<br /><br />People keep trying to apply the same logic to bitcoin as they would to stocks etc. &nbsp; We have never seen anything like bitcoin, it does not follow the same rules, or it would already be dead. &nbsp; The ONLY reason to keep fear-mongering on the boards is to try and incite hysteria. &nbsp; I am getting tired of it . . .<br /><br />GLBSE is only a small part of bitcoin usage, nothing even remotely close to what BTCST was. &nbsp; Why would it have a greater effect on the market?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The downfall is mostly all speculation as well, and increases that were expected are also speculation.&nbsp; <br /><br />It goes both ways. The closure of GLBSE is an excuse by bearish speculators to purchase coins at a cheaper price, hence why you see a building wall at $11.7.&nbsp; They want to force the price down to that level, wait for the price to then go back up and sell it off as a profit.<br /><br /></div>

We will be there to profit.<br />None of us believe bitcoin will ever die, nor that it is useless.<br />As speculator (0,3% mtgox) I just love this kind of dips and ups.<br />In the LONG TERM we all believe in BTC price, but in the short term, its all fun!!!<br />Join the joyride!!!.<br /><br />I would bet anyone that we touch $18 before we get under $6.5 if we ever get there again, but righ now I believe that we can go as low as $10,80&#039;s.<br /><br />Could anyone share, once again, a graphic weekday based trend for the last 5 month? or perhaps point me to somewere...</div>

If price goes to 1000000 USD and volume to 2 Bitcoins per day, does the similarly high volume in USD justify the price?<br /><br />The amount of Bitcoins doesn&#039;t shrink just because price is higher. Bitcoin volume shows volume relative to current market cap, and that one went down. As a relative measure for volume, Bitcoin volume is the one to look at.<br /><br />I agree that volume should not stay as high as, say, in February, but the recent drop in volume was a little fast IMO.</div>

In the short term it&#039;s a good excuse to spark a healthy correction though, that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />Thus far the only actual applications for GLBSE have been mining, loans, rarely anything else. Nefario had plans for other stuff but never got there. I&#039;ve been known to underestimate the effect of events though, so maybe I&#039;m wrong. Regardless, I see the closure of GLBSE as a smaller thing than Pirate and the market recovered very well from that, didn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Also, GLBSE does have an alternative called MPEX. That is afaik much more legitimate anyway, there are actually some requirements to get listed over there. GLBSE was a loose cannon and had no diversity, I never even registered. Hopefully something better comes in the future.<br /><br /><br /></div>+1<br />I always considered glbse a liability and at most had 5% of my funds in there... at the time &quot;it hit the fan&quot; I had 0 shares and 0 satoshi&#039;s in there.

But generally, leverage mania wasn&#039;t much help for stability. Remember the spike below 2 USD? Bitcoinica. Remember the flash crash? Bitcoinica. Remember the spike up right afterward? Bitcoinica. Their users were leveraged way over their head for extended periods of time, I remember it all too well how one had to use Bitcoinica&#039;s hedging balance to estimate actual liquidity.<br /><br />Not going to comment on Pirate.<br /><br />The time of stability this spring was after a lot of maniac speculators had been burnt, and most Bitcoiners had sane expectations about price. There just weren&#039;t many people speculating on &quot;To the moon tomorrow&quot; or &quot;ZOMG crash&quot;. Also, wild movements transfer money to those who stabilize. Thus, the extreme swings before might also have helped.</div>

Unless confidence in Bitcoin itself (the protocol, or the reference client&#039;s implementation of it) is impacted. I actually think $11 is quite low (current price is $11.06 as of this writing).<br /><br />I&#039;m planning on spending the rest of my Mt. Gox balance ($140) on $11 coins right now. But price seems to be dropping right now, so I might wait a bit.<br /><br /><b>EDIT:</b> Just bought 12.84 BTC for $142.<br /><br /><i>Cut to price crashing to $8 :D</i></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Production costs matter because of competition. And the mining market is highly competitive, though not as competitive as it could be.<br />Of course with the infamous example of deep sea mud, competition can only take place within the realm of demand. Given a certain demand more competition to fill the demand results in lower prices and verse visa.<br /><br />However since Bitcoin is not prone to consumption like for example gold or grain it&#039;s cumulative production cost are what ultimately matter. There is the factor of lost coins which will limit that influence in the future but currently that influence is just marginal. <br />Another factor and that is what ultimately is the reason for bitcoins volatility is the demand for bitcoin is expressed not in the absolute value on a individual basis but the fraction of total and currently existing coins.</div>
