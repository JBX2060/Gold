					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am running 2 bitcoind instances on ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS server, wallet a and wallet b.&nbsp; The version info from getinfo() for wallet a is<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;version&quot; : 60300,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;protocolversion&quot; : 60001,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;walletversion&quot; : 60000,<br /></div><br />The version info from getinfo() for wallet b is<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;version&quot; : 70200,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;protocolversion&quot; : 60002,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;walletversion&quot; : 60000,<br /></div><br />If I try to export wallet.dat from wallet a, put it in an empty .bitcoin directory and run it with the latest client version (7.0.2) I get the following error<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">Bitcoin: wallet.dat corrupt, salvage failed<br /></div><br />Obviously wallet b will run with the latest client as seen in the version output.&nbsp; This leads me to believe that the issue is the protocol version.&nbsp; For some reason 60001 is incompatible with the latest client, and 60002 is.<br /><br />So, here is the 10 btc question:<br />How can I get wallet a to run on the latest client?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t work for me to just transfer the balance to a new wallet, because I need the addresses in wallet a.&nbsp; Also, wallet a has a bunch of addys.&nbsp; It&#039;s around 1 gb in size.<br /><br />First person to post a solution that I can get to work wins the 10 btc.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Try to detach databases on shutdown and then replace the wallet.<br />You have to do that when upgrading from 0.6.x to 0.7.x<br /><br />Not sure if you should also copy the blockchain data, to make it think you are upgrading.<br /><br />BTW, this is a wild guess ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">On the options window there is a checkbox with that text. Check it. Close the client. It will take a few minutes to completely close while it detaches the DB&#039;s.<br /><br />Your best option will be to probably copy the entire bitcoin data dir to the new location, instead of copying just the wallet.dat.<br />Don&#039;t forget to backup any data before replacing it. &lt;--- can&#039;t be said enough times :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ideas i got:<br /><br />1. import your wallet.dat to blockchain, and extract it from there (maybe it will fix it)<br />2. There is a program somewhere around here, that extracts the private keys from the wallet.dat file (and then you import them to the other wallet)<br />3. I tried googling how to get private keys from old wallet, and got manyyy results, i think you will too &nbsp;:P<br /><br /><br />Hope i helped a little, and even a little part of those 10 btc would make me very happy :)<br /><br />(im trying to find the program name)<br /><br /><br />EDIT: blockchain.info can also hand you your private keys after you imported the wallet.dat <br />see https://blockchain.info/wallet/import-wallet<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">nethead, blockchain.info My Wallet has a limit of 400 private keys in each wallet. That&#039;s probably an important detail to keep in mind.<br />I would need 10 or more My Wallet accounts to be able to import my 15MB wallet.dat with 4000+ addresses.<br />OP says his wallet.dat is 1GB in size.</div>

You&#039;ll still need to find a way to import them on a new wallet, beacuse AFAIK pywallet only let&#039;s you import 1 private key at a time.<br /><br />BTW, could you do one small thing, just to troubleshoot?<br />Can you rename your wallet a and let the 0.6.1 client create a new wallet.dat and try running that newly created wallet on the 0.7.2 client, just to see if it works?<br />Or maybe you already did that :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ok, pywallet works well to get the privkeys from wallet a, but unfortunately it is not designed to work with wallets with versions later than 32500, so when I try to import into a new wallet, the wallet gets corrupted.<br /><br />So, I am very close, and I like this bulk import/export method because I can prune this giant wallet I have, but I am at a loss how to import the addresses.&nbsp; The new client has the importprivkey function, but it takes 1-2 minutes per address to import.<br /><br />Does anyone know a way to import privkeys into a wallet quickly?</div>
