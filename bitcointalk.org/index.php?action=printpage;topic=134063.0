					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So I had a machine crash. I was not that worried I had several backups of wallet.dat. <br /><br />I wiped the .bitcoin directory and coppied wallet.dat and waited for blockchain download. <br /><br />I was surprised that a ballance came up almost at once and that it was about 1200 BTC short, but I waited for the download. <br /><br />Now the download has completed, it seems that many transactions are missing, payments to addresses created a long time ago seem present. Those to recently created addresses not so. <br /><br />I have done a bitcoin --rescan, and that made no difference. <br /><br />Now the various backups of wallet.dat that I have are significantly different in size. <br /><br />Perhaps I just have to do the reload with a different, older or bigger wallet.dat? <br /><br />Advice? <br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry to hear that. Yes, recently created keys are probably gone :(<br />To prevent loosing your BTCs in future, add keypool=somelargenumber to bitcoin.conf. Default value is 100, so you need to back up your wallet after every 100 used addresses.<br /><br />To recover most of your bitcoins, use most recent backup you have.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No, the recent addresses are missing, but I do believe I may not have used the most recent backup. <br /><br />At the moment swapped the wallet.dat, and am doing a rescan. <br /><br />In fact it really doesnt make any difference how long this takes, but from a biting the fingernails approach, it would seriously reduce my stress levels if I knew these were safe. <br /><br />Now how could I forget that a recent backup of wallet.dat was needed, I thought any wallet.dat backup would do. <br /><br />Really kicking myself here. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it seems I&#039;m not out of the woods yet. Its been an hour, and still there are 4 blocks to download. It still says Last received block was generated 17 minutes ago. <br /><br />So maybe I need to delete the blockchain data and download all from scratch. <br /><br />I tried making a small payment to myself and got: <br /><br />A fatal error occurred. Bitcoin can no longer continue safely and will quit.<br /><br />EXCEPTION: St13runtime_error&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />CDB() : can&#039;t open database file wallet.dat, error -30974&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />bitcoin in Runaway exception&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So now I have a choice. Redownload the entire blockchain using this wallet, or use a slightly older backup that was like this one, approx double the size of earlier ones.&nbsp; That one was a better quality backup in that it was taken from a non-running bitcoin if I remember. <br /><br />Which to try first? <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For his own sake I hope he didn&#039;t use the same hard drive for the next system. <br /><br />If he used the same drive, chances are slim - but not 0%. If the harddrive is big enough there&#039;s a good chance that the old data is still physically stored on the old drive and thus recoverable with specialized software tools. Switch off and use a different drive to test your wallet backups.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well I am happy to say there was a happy solution to this. The machine it was running on became progressively less reliable and eventually refused to boot. It was a thermal or power supply problem. At last a good use for one of those old bitcoin mining machines that are still on my credit card, dam it! A new machine with the same harddisk is now running. And I have downloaded the blockchain to resync bitcoin-qt from scratch. <br /><br />This is clearly what happened. After the first sudden power down event, the existing blockchain data and wallet.dat seemed to be corrupt. <br />I then used an old backup of wallet.dat that unknown to me was taken before the new chunk of receiving addresses were generated - none of the new addresses including some big transactions where in the resynced client! Hence my panic. At this stage I found a more recent backup up used that and all was well. <br /><br />But lets look a little more deeply into this ... (Because believe me I am psychologically scarred, wouldnt you be?? ) <br />Lets suppose I didnt have that backup. I think recovery would still be really easy. All I would need to do would be to generate some new receiving addresses, and suddenly a new chunk of addresses would be generated. (Or force this using command line arguments.) Because this is a deterministic process, suddenly, poof, my bitcoins would come back. I mean one wallet.dat is based on one initial set of private keys, so from that point of view, any old wallet.dat backup will do wont it? Please be aware I am speculating here, I am saying you only need one back up of wallet.dat, but I am saying it quietly for fear of misleading people in case I am wrong, and also because its clearly more convenient to have more recent backups given a choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is this right? <br /><br /></div>
