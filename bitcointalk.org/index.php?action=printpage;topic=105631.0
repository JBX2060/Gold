					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bitcoin-Insurance.com is ready to launch, but I would feel much saver with one or two other people checking the code for security holes.<br /><br />The code is written in php with codeigniter, so some knowledge there is usefull.<br /><br />As backend we use a bitcoind running on the server and ABE to read the chain and load the data into a mysqlDB from which its read later (abe in no server mode). The wallet is kept offline. I didnt write the code myself this time and to be honest I dont trust my friend who coded the backend nor myself to find all security holes he may have left there.<br /><br />Edit: Those who are interested, could they summarize small a bit why they are qualified for something like said? I dont want to send my code to everybody and therfor I only want to pick trustworthy people with some years experience in this field.<br /><br />A thousand thanks upfront!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I could investigate the code.<br />However I&#039;m sure you were hoping for someone with more reputation for doing such things.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You better talk with a specialized company that does this and this alone.<br />You could pm me the code and I would be happy to give it a look for free, but I wouldn&#039;t if I where in you. <br /><br />Btw why ci and not kohana? That&#039;s an awesome framework! :)<br /><br />Btw-2, security trought obscurity works well.</div>
