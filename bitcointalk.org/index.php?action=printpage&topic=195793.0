					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How did you manage to connect to Blastbob&#039;s pool? I&#039;m trying to run my own p2pool instance, but it won&#039;t connect to the p2pool network. I&#039;m using this P2Pool fork: https://github.com/chrda/p2pool-chncoin<br /><br />Would you mind sharing your source code? Thank you very much in advance!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve taken the network parameters from the codebase you quoted, it should work fine. It connects to blastbobs network by default (bootstrap address p2pool.chnco.in pool01.chnco.in, I think thats him), some other P2Pool for CNC have chosen their own network (maybe using different codebase). <br /><br />Check that port 12388 is allowed through the firewall, it should connect to other peers then.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">let me know if you are getting expected payouts please<br /><br />personally have my own 1MH/s pointed at the pool and made about 6.9 CNC in last hour (should be like 9CNC per hour at 1MH/s according to calculator and current difficulty, so its in the area, but not quite), since its P2Pool it might come in later though in a bigger burst (at least from what I have seen in the past)</div>

If you don&#039;t manage to submit a p2pool share (which have high difficulty) at least one time during the 3 block window (on average ~3 minutes) you don&#039;t get any payout.<br /><br />So everything is fine: it adds variance for each payout but they happen often enough to smooth it out in a few hours for most people.<br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I mined for about an hour with 4.2Mh before I got my first 2 payments of about 2.4CHN each, then nothing for the following 30 minutes (and nothing since) and so I went back to a pushpool server.<br /><br />In my experience every P2Pool I tried was the same, there is something inherently wrong with P2Pool that I presume is related to the PPLNS system they have implemented.<br /><br />I initially thought that if I contributed 10% of the shares since the last block was found, I would receive 10% of the block (less fees), but it&#039;s not the case.<br /><br />I read elsewhere that it might be looking at the last 3 blocks worth of shares when calculating the reward, given new blocks were coming every second and the reject rate was so high it&#039;s highly likely that you might have contributed 10% of the shares but at the moment the block is found you haven&#039;t submitted one in the last 3 seconds and therefore get nothing.<br /><br />Please note I&#039;m not having a go at the pool ops, they did a fantastic service to us all especially during the initial period after launch, but for me they need to go back to the simpler block found, count shares, send payment and dump the PPLNS part</div>

The low number of shares is also expected as P2Pool only counts shares with high enough difficulty, this is also normal operation, Im seeing the same on my 1000KH/s rig.<br /><br />I have 1200kh/s pointed at the pool, according to http://cnc.strament.com/calculator.php that should net 101.7 CNC per 24 hours, or 4.23 per hour. <br /><br />I started mining again when the pool was up exactly 2.5 hours before now, since then I have received 8.5 CNC, at the theoretical rate I should see 10.575 CNC for 2.5 hours work, so its about 2 CNC short. Given that all CNC P2Pools I have seen, including this one, have about ~20% DOA Shares, that would account for the missing ~2 CNC.<br /><br />So Im assuming so far the payouts are working as expected given the ~20% DOA shares, please report your own payouts if you suspect any issues.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">just noticed that even though you use the cmdline options for cgminer from the first post it might not set the Scantime and Expiry correctly (e.g. if you had a slightly corrupted cgminer.conf file, which I just found out to be my case), which is quite important to get good results. <br /><br />You can check (or change) if the values are correct (Scantime: 5, Expiry 5) by pressing S while cgminer is running, then press S again to change the Scantime to 5, then E to change the Expiry to 5 if they are not, e.g. it should look like this:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">[P]ool management [G]PU management [S]ettings [D]isplay options [Q]uit<br />&nbsp;GPU 0: &nbsp;74.0C 2092RPM | 214.9K/216.3Kh/s | A:46 R:15 HW:0 U:6.42/m I:17<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />[Q]ueue: 1<br />[S]cantime: 5<br />[E]xpiry: 5<br />[W]rite config file<br />[C]gminer restart<br />Select an option or any other key to return</div><br />This should reduce rejected shares in most cases if you were running with Scantime 60 and Expiry 120 before, which are the defaults</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">anyone care to comment on payouts (whether good or bad!)? personally im seeing more or less expected payouts at 1200KH/s, the payout statistics on the graphs page seem wrong though, I get sometimes more and sometimes less than reported there, not sure why the stats are not correct, check your wallet to see if you are getting expected payouts (looking at 2 or 3 hour periods, since this is PPLNS there is variance)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">decided to disconnect from the p2pool network used by https://github.com/chrda/p2pool-chncoin and run the node standalone (one small node in asia is also joined atm) with some tweaked parameters (instead of last 3 blocks from the aforementioned code it should now consider any shares submitted over last 120 blocks, this is same as most feathercoin p2pool&#039;s), this should result in much better payouts for everyone, first block was already found!<br /><br />due to the changeover there was about 20 minutes of hickup for all miners, sorry about that but hopefully the payouts will be better now!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I setup a test node with better P2Pool parameters, if anyone wants to point miners at it here it goes (and yes if blocks are found this will pay better than if you join an existing p2pool since you will be first in line and the parameters are more sensible too):<br /><br />http://paysmorecnc.crabdance.com:8888/<br /><br />If anyone wants to join their node to the network they can get the original P2Pool code (11.4) from https://github.com/forrestv/p2pool<br />You would start P2Pool just as if you would want to mine litecoin (after making the below code changes!), so e.g. I use:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">./run_p2pool.py --net litecoin -a yourChnCoinAddress --w 8888 --bitcoind-p2p-port 8106 --bitcoind-rpc-port 8108 yourChncoindUser yourChncoindPass<br /></div><br />then exchange the litecoin= definitions in p2pool/networks.py and p2pool/bitcoin/networks.py as follows:<br /><br />p2pool/networks.py:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"> &nbsp; &nbsp;litecoin=math.Object(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PARENT=networks.nets[&#039;litecoin&#039;],<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SHARE_PERIOD=30, # seconds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CHAIN_LENGTH=12*60*60//10, # shares<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;REAL_CHAIN_LENGTH=12*60*60//10, # shares<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TARGET_LOOKBEHIND=200, # shares<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SPREAD=120, # blocks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IDENTIFIER=&#039;43484E636F696D21&#039;.decode(&#039;hex&#039;),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PREFIX=&#039;B4C305FD74B0DEBE&#039;.decode(&#039;hex&#039;),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P2P_PORT=12338,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MIN_TARGET=0,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MAX_TARGET=2**256//2**20 - 1,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PERSIST=False,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WORKER_PORT=8888,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BOOTSTRAP_ADDRS=&#039;paysmorecnc.crabdance.com&#039;.split(&#039; &#039;),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ANNOUNCE_CHANNEL=&#039;#p2pool-alt&#039;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VERSION_CHECK=lambda v: True,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;),<br /></div><br />p2pool/bitcoin/networks.py:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"> &nbsp; &nbsp;litecoin=math.Object(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P2P_PREFIX=&#039;fbc0b6db&#039;.decode(&#039;hex&#039;),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P2P_PORT=8106,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ADDRESS_VERSION=28,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RPC_PORT=8108,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RPC_CHECK=defer.inlineCallbacks(lambda bitcoind: defer.returnValue(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;chncoinaddress&#039; in (yield bitcoind.rpc_help()) and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;not (yield bitcoind.rpc_getinfo())[&#039;testnet&#039;]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SUBSIDY_FUNC=lambda height: 88*100000000 &gt;&gt; (height + 1)//4625280,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;POW_FUNC=lambda data: pack.IntType(256).unpack(__import__(&#039;ltc_scrypt&#039;).getPoWHash(data)),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BLOCK_PERIOD=60, # s<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SYMBOL=&#039;CNC&#039;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CONF_FILE_FUNC=lambda: os.path.join(os.path.join(os.environ[&#039;APPDATA&#039;], &#039;chncoin&#039;) if platform.system() == &#039;Windows&#039; else os.path.expanduser(&#039;~/Library/Application Support/chncoin/&#039;) if platform.system() == &#039;Darwin&#039; else os.path.expanduser(&#039;~/.chncoin&#039;), &#039;chncoin.conf&#039;),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL_PREFIX=&#039;http://cnc.cryptocoinexplorer.com/block/&#039;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ADDRESS_EXPLORER_URL_PREFIX=&#039;http://cnc.cryptocoinexplorer.com/address/&#039;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SANE_TARGET_RANGE=(2**256//1000000000 - 1, 2**256//1000 - 1),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DUMB_SCRYPT_DIFF=2**16,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;),<br /></div></div>
