					Title: <b>Humble Micro Mining Faucet for the little miner with payments to faucethub</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Web mining is fine when you have at least, (or at most) access to a browser<br /><br />If you have total control over your computer, the best choice is to run a native miner, like https://github.com/OhGodAPet/cpuminer-multi (https://github.com/OhGodAPet/cpuminer-multi), and connect to a pool but, you may have noticed that minimum payments are high and, in order to withdraw, you have to let your computer running many many days<br /><br />A better approach would be to use a micro payment system like faucethub ... So I made a little mining group where you can connect either through its web miner or a native one, and receive micro payments to faucethub as you would do with a regular faucet.<br /><br />It only supports BTC, ETH, DOGE ... i suppose i will add more coins<br /><br />Its web miner can be found here http://referralrotator.com (http://referralrotator.com) select your coin, default is BTC<br /><br />Instructions on how to connect can also be found there. Connect to a pool is easy, tweaking values to get the maximum power from your computer is a little bit difficult (not that difficult). As you may guessed, your computer will be mining Monero XMR, and payments are based on pair exchange, which vary over time<br /><br />I only tested it with linux, but it should work with any SO<br /><br />Finally its rotator also rotates references, which means that your address will appear as referrer from times to times, based on your rank, thus you will be earning some extra referral coins<br /><br />I wish you like this approach, it is useful for faucet users<br />Regards<br /><br /><br /></div>
