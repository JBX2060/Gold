					Post by: <b>SgtSpike</b> on <b>October 03, 2012, 07:34:55 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am utilizing the &quot;Bitcoin Classes&quot; by Mike Gogulski and theymos in some PHP code I am playing with.&nbsp; As I understand it, the format for a sendmany is as follows:<br /><br />$array[address[amount]]<br /><br />Well, I can&#039;t send multiple times to the same address in the same sendmany in this format, since the address would be non-unique.&nbsp; So, what would be the proper array format to sendmany to the same address multiple times?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bitcoin classes doesn&#039;t have a sendtomany function, but if you want to do sendtomany with a jsonRPCClient then you just need an array that is setup like $array(&quot;address&quot;=&gt;amount); or $array[&#039;address&#039;]=amount;<br /><br />Cause you it will have to be ran thru json_encode to get it to the correct format.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You might want to wrap the amounts in floatval(); Also you need to json_encode the array that is the issue you can&#039;t just pass the array.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The bitcoind sendmany RPC call uses destination addresses as JSON Object keys, so you can&#039;t send to the same address multiple times in one transaction.<br /><br />If you REALLY want to do that... first, why do you want to do that? I suppose if you want to use the blockchain as a messaging system then sending 0.123+0.567+etc might be an inefficient way of sending a message... but please don&#039;t do that.<br /><br />Anyway, if you do REALLY want to do that, you&#039;ll have to write code to construct the transaction yourself. Then you could pass it to the signrawtransaction/sendrawtransaction RPC methods to broadcast it.&nbsp; (you can&#039;t use createrawtransaction to create it, because it uses the same JSON syntax as sendmany for destination outputs).<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, it&#039;s a bummer that you cannot specify the same address twice - I once suffered from this as well, but a workaround was fairly simple, especially in PHP.<br /><br />A bigger issue I&#039;ve had with sendmany is that the command requires the &quot;&lt;fromaccount&gt;&quot; parameter and you cannot just say to it like &quot;whatever account&quot;...<br />So the way I use my client, having coins spread across several &quot;accounts&quot; (which I personally only use to label addresses), then it seems like someone had made this parameter mandatory just to piss me off... ;)</div>
