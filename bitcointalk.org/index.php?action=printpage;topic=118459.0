Physicists propose method to determine if universe is a simulation</span><br /><br /><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg/600px-CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg/600px-CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg</a><br /><br /><b>(Phys.org)—A common theme of science fiction movies and books is the idea that we&#039;re all living in a simulated universe—that nothing is actually real. This is no trivial pursuit: some of the greatest minds in history, from Plato, to Descartes, have pondered the possibility. Though, none were able to offer proof that such an idea is even possible. Now, a team of physicists working at the University of Bonn have come up with a possible means for providing us with the evidence we are looking for; namely, a measurable way to show that our universe is indeed simulated. They have written a paper describing their idea and have uploaded it to the preprint server arXiv.<br /></b><br />The team&#039;s idea is based on work being done by other scientists who are actively engaged in trying to create simulations of our universe, at least as we understand it. Thus far, such work has shown that to create a simulation of reality, there has to be a three dimensional framework to represent real world objects and processes. With computerized simulations, it&#039;s necessary to create a lattice to account for the distances between virtual objects and to simulate the progression of time. The German team suggests such a lattice could be created based on quantum chromodynamics—theories that describe the nuclear forces that bind subatomic particles.<br /><br />To find evidence that we exist in a simulated world would mean discovering the existence of an underlying lattice construct by finding its end points or edges. In a simulated universe a lattice would, by its nature, impose a limit on the amount of energy that could be represented by energy particles. This means that if our universe is indeed simulated, there ought to be a means of finding that limit. In the observable universe there is a way to measure the energy of quantum particles and to calculate their cutoff point as energy is dispersed due to interactions with microwaves and it could be calculated using current technology. Calculating the cutoff, the researchers suggest, could give credence to the idea that the universe is actually a simulation. Of course, any conclusions resulting from such work would be limited by the possibility that everything we think we understand about quantum chromodynamics, or simulations for that matter, could be flawed.<br /><br /><b>More information: </b>Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation, arXiv:1210.1847 [hep-ph] arxiv.org/abs/1210.1847 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1847)<br /><br /><b>Abstract</b><br />Observable consequences of the hypothesis that the observed universe is a numerical simulation performed on a cubic space-time lattice or grid are explored. The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation with unimproved Wilson fermion discretization and investigate potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g-2 and the current differences between determinations of alpha, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, b^(-1) &gt;~ 10^(11) GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.<br /></div></div>

Only enough computing power to observe so much at a time.<br /></div><br />Thats what I was thinking as well (if you are getting at the same idea as I am).<br />If the universe and everything what&#039;s in it is a simulation, including our very existences and actions, how are we supposed to know?<br /><br />Two ways come to mind (essentially what those guys are trying to do also):<br /><br /><b>1.: Go to the boundaries of the simulation.</b><br />What that means is: Anything (as far as we know) can only be simulated to a certain degree in detail. After that point either computing power comes to its limits or there is no point in making the simulation more detailed. Like creating a 3D world for recreational purposes. You cannot be infinitely precise with the number of polygones as computing power sets the limits but most of the time you dont even have to, because for most purposes a certain degree of detail of sufficient to create the natural environment you desire for your application/simulation.<br />Same principle with &quot;reality&quot;. If it is a simulation, there will be limits of detail, like definite smallest particles or absolute zero temperature. Limits of whats feasible and/or reasonable to compute in a simulation.<br /><b><br />2.: Find inconsistencies.</b><br />If we can find (and science has done so many times in its history) inconsistencies in the way the universe works, based on predictions of older theories, we can gather evidence that something is &quot;wrong&quot;. What usually happens if some inconsistency is discovered in any theory is that it is changed and adapted to whats observed in order to no more cause friction between what is supposed to happen and what actually happens. That can be seen as a natural and totally justified way of science to approach truth and improve its theories. If we on the other hand find some &quot;real&quot; inconsistencies that expose a flaw in the rules imposed on the simulation by those that created our universe, then we are at risk of disregarding those inconsistencies as flaws our own theories rather then flaws of rules of the universe (what an absurd idea, right?). One of the many still not disregarded inconsistencies is the black hole singularity and also the big bang singularity, where familiar rules of the universe seem not to apply. It may be, because it posed too much overhead for the creators to completely compute those cases, so they just left it untouched and patched that inconsistency up with some exception rule. Who knows. If we look for the borders of the simulation and of what its capable of, we may find some more inconsistencies of the system.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is a spinoff of the holographic cosmology model where the faster than light expanding universe has an event horizon boundary layer like black holes have an event horizon where matter that fall in appears to stay at the horizon to the outside observer, while the observer inside the event horizon sees matter pass as normal (some math proofs that both realities exist). If that&#039;s the case with our universe, galaxies and we exist also on the 2D&nbsp; surface on the expanding universe and we are just 3d projections of the 2D surface reality.<br /><br />The argument for this theory is that such a 2D surface on the bit level (the Planck scale in physics), can hold the exact amount of information needed to describe every force and particle in our inside 3D universe.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is not enough for a theory, and trying to support it with statistics, is just another way to calculate the same known relation, and not adding anything to the theory. What these guys should be doing is to formulate a standard model in 2D+time space, then I would start think they were on to something.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You&#039;ll have to google the holographic universe, there are Youtube videos also. But basically they say that our world exists on the outside flat surface of our universe, but to us appears to be 3D, like a hologram.<br /><br />They use Einstein to explain how our world is perceived as 3D and Quantum mechanics to explain why information is conserved in the event horizon.<br /><br />Hawkings and Penrose also applied Quantum Mechanics to describe the event horizon of black holes, but they don&#039;t claim to be sure of what is happening on the inside, except that it is the same space as outside. If the Holographic universe is a fact, it sounds like there could be an entire universe within every black hole, but that runs into other problems with General relativity and inflation.<br /><br />There is a cosmology forum; http://www.physicsforums.com. Often a famous physicist drops by and nails a thread. It&#039;s also where bored LHC employees go in their spare time to discuss experiments. Quite a fascinating forum and no questions are to plain to get an answer! I&#039;m a hobby cosmologist and have learned a lot by just reading old posts there.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This thread reminds me of a theory from Nikodem Poplawski (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikodem_Pop%C5%82awski) according to which the universe might be inside a black hole (and that black holes are actually alternate universes).<br /><br />I have to dig into his work one of this days because it&#039;s much more credible than one might think.<br /><br />Did you know that apart from neutron stars and black holes, the only thing whose radius is of the same order of magnitude than its Scharzchild radius is the observable universe itself??<br /><br />If you link this to the holographic principle, then a black hole&#039;s horizon is kind of a 2D quantum-computer which simulates its own universe. &nbsp;And we would be the result of such a simulation.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the proposed test in this thread could be applied though. &nbsp;From what I understand, they imagined kind of an inferior type of computer. &nbsp;Not as powerful as a black hole horizon. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just watched &quot;the 13th floor&quot; for the first time. &nbsp;It was nice. &nbsp;Funny it came out the same year Matrix did.<br /><br />It made me think of the following dialog:<br /><br />«<br />- Damn those simulated human beings are so annoying. &nbsp;They keep exploring the artificial world we create for them.<br />- So? That&#039;s good right? &nbsp;It means they have curiosity and initiative.<br />- Yeah, but eventually they always manage to find out the limit of the domain and then they realize they are not real. &nbsp;It&#039;s messed up. &nbsp;So we have to make an other world and reboot the whole thing.<br />- Can&#039;t you make a bigger world? &nbsp;Or a world topologically round? &nbsp;Like a sphere?<br />- We did. &nbsp;We made a round planet for them to live on, with a force that attracts them to the center, so that people on the lower half don&#039;t fell off.<br />- Makes sense. &nbsp;Did that work?<br />- Nope, they did explore the whole planet but those morons also started to look at the sky. &nbsp;Like, &quot;with a telescope&quot; look.<br />- What&#039;s the problem with that?<br />- The problem is that it gave them the idea of exploring space as well.<br />- Jeez. &nbsp;And now you need to make a closed-curved universe as well?<br />- Screw that. &nbsp;I don&#039;t have enough energy and resource to do something like that. &nbsp;I&#039;ll make it simpler. &nbsp; I&#039;ll make it look like the universe is extremely big and that stars are separated by huge distances, like light-years distances.<br />- Won&#039;t work: &nbsp;at some point they&#039;ll manage to increase the speed of their spaceships and they&#039;ll reach your limits again.<br />- Yeah, that&#039;s why I&#039;ll add a rule saying that mass increases with speed, so that one needs an infinite amount of energy to accelerate above the speed of light.<br />- I see. &nbsp;With such a rule, interstellar space travel will never be possible for them so whatever they do they&#039;ll never encouter the limits of your data. &nbsp;Good work.<br />»</div>

It would. Barring something like the Alcubierre drive (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive), you cannot get anywhere, even to our nearest stellar neighbor, within a human lifetime. <br /><br />This is because in order to get something to go faster, you have to push it harder. In order to push it harder, you need more fuel. The more fuel you have, the more weight you need to push, and the harder you have to push it to get going the same speed. The faster something moves, the heavier it gets, meaning to push it faster, you need more fuel to push harder, which in itself is getting heavier, requiring more fuel to push it harder....<br /><br />And around and round we go.<br /><br />It would not stop <i>expansion</i>, assuming you were willing to hop on a colony ship and either freeze yourself for centuries or resign yourself to the fact that it&#039;s going to be your distant descendents that actually colonize the new world (if you can find one), and you&#039;ll die before you&#039;re really even on your way. Exploration, on the other hand, requires explorers that can go out, check several places, and get back to make reports before they die. Not going to happen with slowships. Probes, with radios that can reach back home, are an option, but not technologically feasible at the moment.</div>

The only problem is a long loooong time would have passed on (virtual)-Earth ; quite a challenge for the simulation to stay accurate IMO.

That is exactly the position of the simulation engine, sooo ...)<br /><br />But anyway, the Lorentz equations. may not be part of the simulation :)<br /><br /></div>
