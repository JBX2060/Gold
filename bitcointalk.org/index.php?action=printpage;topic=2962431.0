					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Update: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2962431.msg30775971#msg30775971<br /><br />The problem solved, the telegram admin of Arcblock will change my stakes later, you can ask her for help if you have any issues with your stakes. Details :https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2962431.msg30775971#msg30775971<br /><br /><br />Hello, I was one of the participants of Arcblock signature campaign and been one of the first people who joined this campaign. After the second week of this campaign I messaged bounty manager through telegram saying that the amount of stakes caclulated at spreadsheet is wrong and I told her to recheck the calculation on that week<a href="https://i.imgur.com/6XzPh0y.png?1">https://i.imgur.com/6XzPh0y.png?1</a><br /><br />But after I sent her that message she didnt respond me and I dont get any straight answer where it should be sent and tried to conctact with her other days, but nothing changed, so after the end of the campaign I sent a message to other person which also can&#039;t explain why my posts been devided in a half, that&#039;s what she said: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UxPFICO.png?1">https://i.imgur.com/UxPFICO.png?1</a> <br /><br />I made 8 posts in English and 3 at my local language, so I didn&#039;t break any rules of that campaign on the contrary I made more posts, so after she explained her position she said you made only 3 posts at all and that make me more disapointed <a href="https://i.imgur.com/keBzRMS.png?1">https://i.imgur.com/keBzRMS.png?1</a><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That user dont answer also straight to any of my question about why it&#039;s counted only 3 from 11 posts and any endeavors to explain that moment she always changed the topics and no explanation why bounty manager ignored me and do not recount the spreadsheet not given also.<br /><br />Now after that talk she putted me on the blacklist, because i told her that she don&#039;t answered to any of my question and changed topics,also I told that if they not recount my posts I will open Scam thread and that&#039;s what she said : <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lAOqPRE.png?1">https://i.imgur.com/lAOqPRE.png?1</a> . <br /><br />Here I am providing their bitcointalk account : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=984557 (It&#039;s already with - trust)<br />Their admins at bitcointalk @yxm110930 @estheryoyo @holidayQ<br /><br /><br />I worked for this campaign for 4 weeks now I have 0 stakes for my work : <br /><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/c7aYReW.png?2">https://i.imgur.com/c7aYReW.png?2</a><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PwGQatx.png?1">https://i.imgur.com/PwGQatx.png?1</a><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/NDtxboM.png?1">https://i.imgur.com/NDtxboM.png?1</a><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/h7FL4GV.png?1">https://i.imgur.com/h7FL4GV.png?1</a><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The bounty manager also joins the bounty campaign and he got some stakes. Their bounty campaign is full of bots and they even allow newbie accounts to join. And that generates huge spam on Bitcointalk. This should not be allowed. Project is scammy and overhype.<br />https://i.imgur.com/iNyohef.jpg</div>

This is a coin project to create the 3 era of block chain. I believe the project side will not disappoint you.Waiting patiently is the right choice at the moment. 8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Easy guys. They delivered all the bounty for participants , we can not do anything else. Just hope by the end of this year the price will grow to more than 3 numbers. It&#039;s life guys just accept it. In the real life people will kill each other for money. If i have a project like this . I will do the same because there is no free lunch guys. </div>
