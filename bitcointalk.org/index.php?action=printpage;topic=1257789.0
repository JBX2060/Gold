					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looking for a fairly cheap yet reliable seedbox. Don&#039;t need an insane amount of storage but looking for decent upload/download speed. Preferably a pay monthly one too though paying upfront for a few months might be ok if they&#039;re reliable. Thanks. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have to ask what is a seadbox?&nbsp; I have looked it up on the internet and it did not bring up any information that would make your post make sense.&nbsp; So please explain to me what this is and what it is used for.&nbsp; I am just trying to keep up on new technology.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I looked into bitcoin accepting seedboxes a while ago and most seemed to favor large scale purchases. yourseedbox.com has a 2 euro/month shared plan which is the smallest &amp; cheapest I could find. There are limits for active torrents in their shared plans though. <br /><br />you can take a look for yourself here <br /><br />https://yourseedbox.com/page/shared_seedbox</div>

You can only have two on the two Euro a month deal and only 50 on the most expensive package. Think most of the other ones are unlimited by the number of torrents you can have. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve found a couple but they&#039;re not as cheap as I was hoping (though maybe I was expecting too much for too little). Was hoping someone can personally recommend one though rather than just me choosing a random one I found. </div>
