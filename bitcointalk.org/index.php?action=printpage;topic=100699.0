					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello fellow bitcoiners,<br /><br />I often read the blog ZeroHedge (http://www.zerohedge.com/). They have a quite pessimistic but realist view on the economy, and some of the bloggers there often try to sell their &quot;solution&quot; to &quot;protect your capital/wealth against the coming end of the world&quot;. <br /><br />We can all agree that bitcoin is perfectly designed to be a great store of value, being non inflationary, so why not sell our own solution to protect others wealth? I think we can touch a public open to the idea of bitcoin. Plus bitcoin is also perfectly designed to survive a financial meltdown, as it doesn&#039;t need banks to operate. Bref, it&#039;s perfect for the target audience!<br /><br />So whose up to write and submit an article to zerohedge? English isn&#039;t my primary language so I&#039;m not able to produce a well-writen article?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, I finally got around to completing an article for Zero Hedge. Please let me know any suggestions. Also, does anyone have a ZH account for submission? It looks like it takes 4 to 7 days for new account approval. If nobody has an account I&#039;ll create one there and submit. I hereby release this into the public domain. Please feel free to use as you like.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Betting on Bitcoin<br /><br />Word is getting out on bitcoins, a potentially world changing currency. By now many in tech circles have heard of Bitcoin, but still relatively few really know all about it. There isn&#039;t one easy-to-understand all encompassing guide. This results in misconceptions about Bitcoin which is complex, being both a currency and payment network for that currrency. To fully appreciate Bitcoin one really needs a good understanding of math, cryptography, computer networking, programming, economics, and the nature of &quot;money&quot;. In light of that it&#039;s no wonder this open-source project is sometimes erroneously summed up as a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;.<br /><br />Still, many people around the world are betting Bitcoin will be around in the future. The bitcoin/dollar exchange rate has gone from a few cents in 2009 when Bitcoin started to over $10 per coin as of August 2012. <br /><br />To answer what exactly Bitcoin is it&#039;s helpful to know several key things:<br /><br />1. Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority; it&#039;s completely decentralized <br />2. Bitcoins come into existence (as defined by the protocol, which everyone agrees to by using) through a process called &quot;mining&quot; which involves using a computer to solve a problem of varying difficulty <br />3. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins generated; the problem difficulty is adjusted automatically so bitcoin creation follows a fairly stable and known inflation rate [1] <br />4. Bitcoins can be subdivided to 8 decimal places<br />5. Bitcoins obtain a value because people want them for different reasons, and they are scarce (the same way gold obtains value) <br />6. Bitcoins, if used properly, can provide anonymity for their use <br />7. Bitcoins can be used to transfer any amount of value around the world, almost instantly, by anyone, with little or no cost<br />8. The Bitcoin code has been reviewed by many qualified experts (it&#039;s open-source) and serious flaws, in terms of bugs, have yet to be found<br />9. It&#039;s unlikely any entity, such as a government, could entirely prevent the use or growth of Bitcoin without shutting down the entire Internet<br /><br />With those qualities one may begin to understand the potential Bitcoin brings, but who is supposed to use it and how? <br /><br />Bitcoin draws to it anyone wanting payment freedom. Bitcoin accounts can&#039;t be frozen, and anonymous payments are possible if precautions are taken. Bitcoins are also a global currency, so while their legal status is now in a gray area, should they ever be outlawed somewhere it wouldn&#039;t mean they were outlawed everywhere; that would put pressure on regimes doing the outlawing.&nbsp; <br /><br />More specifically, some Bitcoin users might be described as libertarian minded. Many of Bitcoin&#039;s proponents have even been called the digital equivalent of &quot;gold bugs&quot; because bitcoins work similar to gold as currency since they can&#039;t be arbitrarily inflated.<br /><br />While it may not be easy to understand bitcoins, it&#039;s straightforward to use them. All that&#039;s needed is a standard computer and Internet connection to download freely available &quot;wallet&quot; software from sources like bitcoin.org. Wallets use cryptographic keypairs, consisting of a public and private key, for account addresses (e.g. 175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W) allowing users to send coins to one another almost instantly. Ease of use is compared to sending email.<br /><br />There are several ways to obtain bitcoins, including buying them, working or trading for them, or &quot;mining&quot; them. Mining is the term used to describe using a computer to solve the computational problem first and winning bitcoins, thereby bringing them into existence. Anyone can mine for bitcoins using software that is also freely available, but competition is now high. For many people it&#039;s easiest to buy bitcoins.<br /><br />Bitcoins are now exchanged 24/7 for all sorts of things as would be expected of any currency. The web page at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade gives an idea of the type and variety of available goods and services there are for bitcoins.<br /><br />As word continues to spread about bitcoins, and their adoption grows there is a good chance their value will continue to rise - not just compared to fiat currency, but also for the variety of things for which they are accepted. That probably makes bitcoins a very good bet.<br /><br />[1] https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/File:Total_bitcoins_over_time_graph.png<br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think it could be improved before submission. For example include some directions like this:<br /><br /><br />How to protect your bitcoins:<br />Rip out the hard drive and network card of an old laptop, boot from a live cd that includes bitaddress.org script, print out a list of numbers that someone would have to break the 2nd law of thermodynamics to guess. Next, print it out onto a transparency and use this acid ink trick to engrave it into a copper plate. Then piss on the plate to form a protective layer and put it in a safe place. You can transfer as many bitcoins there as you feel like. Now you are your own bank.<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=100899.0</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you for taking the initiative to get Bitcoin on ZeroHedge. &nbsp;Some thoughts:<br /><br />A large portion of the audience (or at least the commenters) are cynical goldbugs and preppers. &nbsp;Although an article introducing Bitcoin might work fine on less ideological audiences, I think that you might be more successful if you do a more ambitious two or three-part offering (or 3-section article) &nbsp;that, aside from introducing Bitcoin, also addresses up front the two main objections and misconceptions likely to come up from the commenter crowd.<br /><br />1. Bitcoin vs. Gold<br />Explaining how they complement each other, why both are necessary under different scenarios like border crossings, confiscation resilience of Bitcoin versus gold, how the stupid objections to gold (&#039;you can&#039;t eat it&#039;) also apply to Bitcoin and vice versa, pointing to George Selgin&#039;s work which correctly classifies Bitcoin as a new type of commodity.<br /><br />2. Bitcoin in a Mad-Max no-electricity no-Internet scenario.<br />Check out the article &quot;Bitcoin Under the Worst Possible Conditions&quot; from the first issue of Bitcoin Magazine. The possibility of resilient peer-to-peer mesh networks. &nbsp;Barter usage via Casascius gold/silver/bitcoin hybrid coins, Bitcoin paper bills, paper wallets, and other no-electricity physical bridges. &nbsp;Etcetera.<br /><br />But to be clear about these suggestions, even if you ignore or disagree with them, I&#039;ll still be grateful, any article is better than no article!</div>

Even if they shoot this attempt down, they&#039;ll be less likely to shoot the next one down, and after they&#039;ve heard about it enough, they&#039;ll eventually publish.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Differentiating bitcoin from state-monopoly currencies issued by centrally-planned banking systems is a good way to draw a parallel with gold without attacking the shibboleth of the gold standard (also a state-sanctioned monopoly currency but best not go there with this article maybe) <br /><br />bitcoin = decentralised, free market-based currency.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey everyone,<br /><br />Thanks for the interest in this. <br /><br />@marcus_of_augustus: no I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a final draft. I believe @DutchBrat is submitting it to ZH to get their feedback on it to see if they would publish it, or perhaps prefer a different writing angle. If you know you can get any type article published that&#039;s awesome! We just need to figure out what that article should be.<br /><br />My goal with the article was introducing Bitcoin, which is an immensely information rich topic, in a fairly concise way while piquing newbie interest to explore it. I was conscious of article length. Everyone is coming up with great ideas for what the article might contain, but remember it can&#039;t contain everything. Typical ZH articles seem to be fairly short. That&#039;s a reason I didn&#039;t suggest using @evoorhees&#039;s Libertarian Primer on Bitcoin (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=76565.0) which I loved, and is comprehensive, but I think too long for ZH.<br /><br />So right now I&#039;m thinking we see how this week progresses, what kind of feedback we get from ZH about a Bitcoin article. I&#039;m really not familiar with their audience.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not bad, it reaches a new audience readily enough. My tack would be a bit different. A lot of those guys are running trade desks and funds. I&#039;d put up a cost-analysis on trading the arb in bitcoin, and when you got to the friction involving moving funds to other exchanges, show how opening your own exchange in a country that doesn&#039;t require too much overhead would improve the total picture.<br /><br />That could whet the appetite for some of the financial types to start registering services, if only to trade it.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lots of good ideas... Below is my take, which approaches the introduction of bitcoin from a macro-economic &quot;the current system is broken&quot; standpoint. I read zerohedge somewhat often, and I believe this fits very nicely with the existing economic consensus of the zerohedge crowd, and also has the benefit of not requiring an up-front in-depth explanation of bitcoin. Obviously there is A LOT to potentially convey about bitcoin; far too much for a single introductory article. Positioning bitcoin as the solution to the current broken fiat money system seems like the right approach to me. The ZH crowd should agree with the background thesis by default, and therefore be, at minimum, intrigued by the theoretical notion of bitcoin, hopefully enough to look into it further:<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Melbustus</div><div class="quote"><br />Better Money<br /><br />As the world deals with $200 trillion in debt, with most &quot;advanced&quot; economies relying on a democracy-fiat system that represents a one-way mathematical function toward a debt spiral, it is obvious to many that our current worldwide money system is broken.

I didn&#039;t position bitcoin and gold as mutually-exclusive. I certainly see your point, but I think it&#039;s a bit laborious to get into the gold discussion at all. The point of the piece should be to simply explain what bitcoin is monetarily, thereby piquing their interest (hopefully). They can then do their own research/analysis to decide what&#039;s what wrt bitcoin+gold. Despite lots ZH readers being gold bugs, a lot are simply open-minded people who recognize that the current system is broken. Maybe this is optimistic (and it&#039;s definitely a very limited sample set), but the guys I know who read ZH regularly are genuinely interested in what&#039;s going on and are curious to read alternative economic viewpoints.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />Why should you learn everything you possibly can about Bitcoin?<br />Let me give you four reasons.<br /><br />1. As Bitcoin spreads like a viral each coin could easily go to $100-$5000.<br />You simply do not want to be left in the dust if/when that happens.<br />2. You and everyone around you need a digital system with sound electronic money, you own. Not the corrupt banking kartel. <br />A system of money not created out of thin air but out of energy.<br /><br />3. It might be unstoppable.<br /><br />As long as there is atleast one person who have downloaded the blockchain containing every single transaction. Which you do with the default program.<br />The network can allways start again.<br />Why? Because anyone can forward transactions by mining. This means that Bitcoin could<br />be virtually unstoppable.<br /><br /><br />Something like that.</div>

Bitcoin democratizes and decentralizes money.<br /><br /></div></div><br />this is by far the best of the three articles. &nbsp; all discussions of Bitcoin need to be placed into the context of defining what exactly is the problem with the current global monetary system. &nbsp;what we&#039;re going thru is a <i>fiat currency crisis</i> and this article articulates the problem clearly while proposing a new and revolutionary solution.</div>

I&#039;ve been waiting for ZH to wake up to this forever, and now they see BTC is an enemy of central banks, and because they are enemies of central banks as well, perhaps they&#039;ll realize that Bitcoin is an ally.</div>

A lot of radars got &#039;pinged&#039; today just having those articles appear on Zerohedge.<br /><br />I also agree with the statement about voting with bitcoin versus in the election - in fact, I tell that to people (who can handle new ideas) that I&#039;m doing just that.<br /><br />It is the only hope of freedom I have at the moment.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Keep in mind, ZH is a financial NEWS site. Btc is not news anymore. Even the events that get us bitcoiners all excited isn&#039;t news worthy to the plebes. It&#039;s still very much a niche thing. There needs to be verifiable facts behind the news. Most of what gets published in the btc-centric news outlets is conjecture, opinion, or rumours. This won&#039;t fly with a traditional hard news agency.<br /><br />That said, I&#039;m guessing someone at ZH is strongly anti-btc because you would think with their left of centre stance and generally libertarian views that they would promote the btc like crazy.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ZH is warming slowley to Bitcoin. Generally the negativity comes from Gold Bug posters who tend to see it as an attack on their personal belief that only Gold is money. <br /><br />I think many there are getting that Bitcoin is actually serving the role Gold is susposed to do is picking up on rumbles in the financial system, inflation and currency debasement etc.<br /><br />I think ZH just had a laugh at the bubble that formed and the foolishness of late investors to a parabolic run up in the charts.<br /><br /><br />I agree there should some actual positive Bitcoin articles on there, I think I saw one the other day. Don&#039;t forget ZH is not just one poster, many are rumoured to post under Tyler Durden name so there can be an inconsistency on Bitcoin on the site.</div>
