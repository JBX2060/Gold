					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I signed up for an account at coinbase.com and verified my account. The site clearly states:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">You have 10.0 BTC remaining of your 10.0 BTC daily limit.</div>When I try to enter any amount (10 BTC or 5 BTC) I receive a message that states:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Sorry, the maximum number of purchases on Coinbase has been reached for today. Please try again in 24 hours. We&#039;ll continue raising this limit over time.</div>This makes no sense since I have not made any transactions through coinbase.com.<br /><br />I have been unable to make a bitcoin purchase since signing up 3 days ago. I&#039;ve emailed support at coinbase and have received no response.&nbsp; Any tips or suggestions? Thanks :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That notification seems like it&#039;s talking about total purchases across all of Coinbase, not just your account.&nbsp; For example, maybe they have an internal limit of selling only up to 10,000 BTC per day.&nbsp; If that limit is reached before you try to place an order, then you&#039;re out of luck.<br /><br />I&#039;d just keep attempting throughout the day and you&#039;ll probably get it at some point.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, it finally worked. It does seem sketchy that this wasn&#039;t working for 3 days. Would have liked to have heard back from coinbase as well. I was also surprised to see that I don&#039;t get the bitcoins for almost a week! I guess this has something to do with the bank transfer. Thanks for the tip.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Cilphex was correct. Coinbase has a daily limit that is site wide. So if other&#039;s make too many transactions they can essentially block you from making a transaction. I didn&#039;t realize that. It would be best if Coinbase gave the message before trying to make a purchase rather than after. Just posting to let others know. Here is the email response I received back from Coinbase:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Hi,<br /><br />Sorry for the confusion on that! The limit you&#039;re seeing is Coinbase&#039;s daily limit being reached, not your personal limit. This is something we&#039;ll be raising in the very near future!</div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The overall coinbase daily limit is a serious problem.&nbsp; I have been trying for 2 days to buy more BTC and they are always &quot;at the limit&quot;.&nbsp; Even just before midnight, just after midnight and at 800 am.&nbsp; The service isnt useful if it is not reliable.&nbsp; It is also very important that people have confidence they can exchange BTC in and out under known predictable rules.&nbsp; Uncertainty destroys confidence.&nbsp; <br /><br />I may have to go and set up another service for buying BTC.....</div>
