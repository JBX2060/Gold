					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a 52 character private key (starts with &#039;L&#039;). &nbsp;The wallet.dat was encrypted some time after the block was solved, and became corrupted to the point that the bitcoin.org client would not open with it. &nbsp;I extracted the keys with pywallet and managed to import and spend all of the block rewards in the wallet except this one. <br /><br />Here is what is interesting:<br />1) I can NOT import the key into an unencrypted wallet with pywallet.<br />2) I can import the key into an encrypted wallet with pywallet, and the balance is shown.<br />3) If I attempt to send all or part of that amount, the client reports &quot;Transaction creation failed&quot;.<br />4) Nothing shows up in the debug log.<br />5) I can import the key to a blockchain wallet and the balance is shown (still cannot send). <br /><br />Is pywallet able to handle 52 character keys correctly? &nbsp;<br />Any ideas why this works with encrypted wallets only?<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Private keys are 51 characters. <br /><br />Maybe your key has an invisible character in it. Has caught me by surprise. Hand retype and see if it works. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The 52 character private keys are paired with compressed public keys. I&#039;ve imported and tried this key in 0.3.x, 0.4.x, and more current clients.&nbsp; Always the same story...&nbsp; It is a valid key---at least it imports to the right address with the lost block reward.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This isn&#039;t really my area, but have you tried using Armoury to import the key.<br /><br />I had issues importing private keys before, tried many clients and blockchain.info, but Armoury came to the rescue in the end.<br /><br />Edit: Post the key :) Lol.</div>

It would probably work.&nbsp; If you&#039;re willing to try this out and need some help, I&#039;ll be available to guide you through getting and merging the patch later today.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just updated my Casascius Bitcoin Address Utility to fully support compressed private keys.&nbsp; So yeah, now I definitely agree, 52 characters for a private key if it&#039;s compressed...<br /><br />There is no way to use a compressed private key with a client that doesn&#039;t support it.&nbsp; There is no &quot;uncompressed equivalent&quot; (well, there is, but it will have a different bitcoin address so it&#039;s useless).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Still working on this one... &gt;:(&nbsp; &nbsp;I can get compressed key compatible clients to show the balance, but they all fail when I try to send them. ???<br /><br />Mike, The Casascius Address tool confirms that the &#039;other address&#039; that I see in some tools or clients is an import of the private key without compressing the public key.&nbsp; </div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have you tried the importprivkey RPC call on a normal bitcoin 0.7.1 node?<br /><br />Sounds to me like the WIF is incorrect, but the tools you are using aren&#039;t checking the checksum, so they happily import it, but since it isn&#039;t right, they can&#039;t actually make a valid signature for it.<br /><br />It would be hard to know more without seeing it, and you probably don&#039;t want to hand a stranger on the internet what could be $500.&nbsp; That said, I&#039;d be willing to take a look at it if you&#039;d like.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">https://casascius.com/btcaddress-alpha.zip is the only version that recognizes compressed public keys. <br /><br />My utility can ignore a bad checksum if you put a ? after the address. Converting it back from hex to WIF will give you one with a recalculated checksum. <br /><br />Perhaps you can share the public key (starts with 02, 03, or 04). This is safe to share and may help. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had a funny private key that the client would not accept.<br /><br />I went to my blockchain.info wallet, then imported it as a private key. It worked, then I went to the &quot;paper wallet&quot; page and it gave me a normal private key that would import to the regular client.<br /><br />If this works sent the bounty to: 1JNv6WZsh8rPfXYaKXXMnuKvsjZKhnoL5d</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">An example of a potential &quot;funny&quot; private key is one that starts with &quot;y&quot;. <br /><br />These are formed when pywallet misbehaves when encountering a private key that starts with a 00 byte. It is malformed but many utilities will still accept it. Others won&#039;t.&nbsp; I believe mine will, since I am aware of the problem and likely would have accommodated it.&nbsp; It can be converted to the proper format with no loss of funds.&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />Circling back to this... (I&#039;ve been way too busy) <br />--By the way Mike, I missed the chance to meet you at DefCon. &nbsp;Maybe next time.<br /><br />J-Norm: paper wallet or key exports just issue the same privkey. &nbsp; :(<br /><br />Anyways, I think I just need to find a client that can sign a transaction with this key. &nbsp;<br /><br /></div>
