					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve seen double-spend analysis worked out by gurus on this forum.&nbsp; The conclusion was that trying to execute a double-spend isn&#039;t economical for low value transactions.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember specifically, but the low end for it to POSSIBLY be profitable was something like $2k-$10k.<br /><br />When your client/wallet service is well connected to the bitcoin network (like a blockchain.info wallet), transactions show up almost instantly.&nbsp; The easy solution is to just accept zero confirmation transactions under a certain value (like in the $1k range), and require confirmations for higher values.&nbsp; This could either be you or your payment processor, who may have insurance that would allow them to offer higher values for zero confirmation instant payment.<br /><br />Another option is just to have a credit card that transacts in bitcoins instead of traditional currency.&nbsp; Credit cards only need approval from their servers, so this would be instant just as it is today.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the intelligent points.&nbsp; I should just accept the risk once I see it clear if it is a face-to-face transaction.&nbsp; Are there BTC credit cards?&nbsp; If so, where can I get one?<br /><br />Thanks again.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You can use MtGox redeemable code to transfer between you and the person you want to transfer to. I&#039;ve done it a few times in the past.</div>
