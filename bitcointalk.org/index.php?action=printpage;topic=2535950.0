					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In a couple of days Bitcoin futures contracts which will be launch on Nasdaq, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group(CME) and others. Bitcoiner believe this will make bitcoin hit the mainstream of payment while something think it cause dump in price of bitcoin just like when gold was added by the stock exchange. <br /><br />The question is, what&#039;s your own point of view? <br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got into bitcoin nearly 2 years ago, really regret not buying more when possible.&nbsp; I think it is likely going to drop a little, but keep surging on as it always does.&nbsp; It goes up, comes down a little, but always stays higher than previous value.&nbsp; If mainstream investors really catch on, it&#039;ll take off and continue to grow.&nbsp; I&#039;m holding some BTC, but turning my attention to other alt coins&nbsp; with better potential.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it was ever the intention of BTC to be a mainstream investment of banks.&nbsp; it was formed because of what banks did to us leading up to 2008</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t see why the price should go down, especially not in the long term. Pump and dump cycles may become more prevalent though, which scares me a little bit. If big investors gain access to lots of bitcoins via futures, they may eventually reach the stage where they can manipulate the market a little bit.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not too worried about it either. Bitcoin has proven to be quite resilient to &#039;bad news&#039; in the last months; wether it was the crackdown on crypto in China some time ago or hardforks, those obstacles were absolutely no match for the BTC-train. If there&#039;s any effect, it&#039;ll probably get washed away largely by the highly erratic &#039;regular&#039; swings on the cryptomarket.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think with the addition of bitcoin futures the price will go up. There will always be the pump and dump going on but the price should steadily rise I think. It will make it a little more mainstream even though the futures won’t nescesarily make it as mainstream as it would be I’d say amazon start d to accept bitcoin as payment. I believe it will help the price rise in the future. I’m all for it the more people start using bitcoin the better it will be in the long run. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is really hard to say what will happen this month. We are going to have another hard fork which may cause the price to rise. However, I doubt it will have any significant value. Hedge contracts will have a huge impact on Bitcoin price. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if someone started to pump it and then &quot;whales&quot; could bet that Bitcoin will decrease. The price will be changing a lot in the following months, mostly because of this event. Holding is what I would recommend anyone. Check what happened to Bitcoin in December 2015.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If they are looking forward for investing in Bitcoins and selling bitcoins future thus they will back out only when they have attained a minimum set of profit and that would only happen when they will for sure be in the line till a long time or..if not long then at least 6 months or an year thus till then they won&#039;t dump the bitcoins.<br /><br />After their set time period they will for sure sell out bitcoins soley dependent on their individual deals and demans and the net idea would be to gain profit thus after that it will be dump for sure.<br /><br />But for the short haul we can expect a pump though for the long dump is underway.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It seems to me that this will cause a price increase. But not a stable increase, but a short-term, after which the price will decrease. Perhaps after this there will be a correction</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The argument that it takes bitcoin more mainstream and adds more investment is very valid but also at the same time I think it will be difficult because it will bring in a lot of sure money. Are people really going to offer futures at 500% for a year or more? What influence will that have on the price either answer? I can&#039;t quite wrap my head around it but I&#039;m sure something strange my happen. If I had to say I feel it my slow growth of bitcoin.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">short term it might create some volatility. Not expecting a crash but not expecting a pump either. Probably just swinging around a bit. Mid-term and long-term this is very bullish because it means Wall St is gonna start getting into actual Bitcoin soon, not just in cash settled futures.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hedge funds sometimes trade pretty aggressively and don&#039;t have the same responsibilities that, say, a pension fund has when dealing with their customers&#039; money, so it&#039;s perfectly possible that they would decide to short BTC after the introduction of futures contracts.<br /><br />However, it&#039;s also possible that if the euphoria of current speculators continues, they will invest in BTC beyond their means, thus increasing the price extremely dramatically.<br /><br />Either way, it&#039;ll most likely increase volatility.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Never sell bitcoin. &nbsp;I thought people would have learned this lesson by now.<br /><br />When bitcoin was dumping real hard a week ago, I read this post by a smart-ass investor who claimed to have sold $100k in bitcoin and was planning to buy back in $25k lots at $7800, $6000, $5000 and $4000 or something like that. &nbsp;It never dropped to those levels and so here we are touching $13k about a week later.<br /><br />Stupid investors are coming to the crypto economy thinking that the crypto economy is some get-rich scheme for getting more US$. &nbsp;They don&#039;t understand. &nbsp;Bitcoin is pumping not because of speculation. &nbsp;It&#039;s pumping because people are abandoning fiat and recognizing fiat is becoming obsolete and has the same value as sand. &nbsp;It&#039;s the US$ that has no value. &nbsp;People reluctantly sell some crypto just to pay taxes or bills, but other than that the money stays in the crypto economy.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be a foolish crypto-tourist.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think the price will fall but that&#039;s because a dip is incoming after this huge rise. Also probably a lot of the rise is hype about futures. Since futures are cash settled and have nothing to do with buying/selling bitcoin there won&#039;t actually be a direct impact so that will probably kill the hype. No doubt the price will head back up in the coming weeks, but a correction is definitely coming in the next few days after this insane week!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Trading futures, this is just a way of not withdrawing money from the stock exchange financial system as it affects the cost of bitcoin.<br />Exchange brokers will not inject real money into the bitcoin market.<br />I think there will be a situation of opposition between the stock exchange brokers and crypto traders. The cost of real bitcoin will be different from that of futures.</div>
