					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Calling <tt>listunspent</tt> gives me a list of {txid,vout,spk,amount,conf}.&nbsp; I also want to determine the account associated with each item in that list.&nbsp; This can be done in two steps: 1) calling <tt>getrawtransaction txid</tt> will get me the address associated with a txid+vout combination; 2) calling <tt>getaccount addr</tt> will finally get me the associated account.<br /><br />This works, but is awfully convoluted.&nbsp; Is there a more straightforward way?&nbsp; I thought about calling <tt>gettransaction txid</tt>, which does provide account information associated with each &quot;receive&quot; address, but I&#039;m not sure whether I can rely on the array order being exactly the same as the original vout.<br /></div>
