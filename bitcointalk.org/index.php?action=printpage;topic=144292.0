					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">this is a question fro BTC developers. <br />But i don&#039;t think it needs to be changed or even if it is, it will be backward compatible,<br />hopefully.<br />Of course, this is my opinion&nbsp; :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">don&#039;t store the wallet.dat. just export the keys into some raw format. The satoshi client can to this.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you&#039;re serious about your wallet try 3+ sticks plus a few CDs. USB sticks have a high failure rate. As others have said, storing just the private keys on a piece of paper is a better idea. Storing them on CDs encrypted is an even better idea!<br /><br />If the format changes (unlikely) there will be a tool to convert to the new format, you can count on that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The concern would be bit rot on a cold storage flash memory. For power-off data retention in flash, the charge that is the store of a bit degrades over time, and thus far storage times have only been estimated based on accelerated testing, since MLC chips have only been out a short while. Manufacturer estimates vary from 1 year to 10 years, but in many cases are not given at all.<br /><br />This paper details some testing, &quot;we typically target three months of data retention time for solid-state in enterprise applications&quot;.<br />http://storageconference.org/2011/Papers/SNAPI/1.Sun.pdf</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just print or write it down on a peice of paper, laminate it or something and store it somewhere safe. Like a safe. </div>
