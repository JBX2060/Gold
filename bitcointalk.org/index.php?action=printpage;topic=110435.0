					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been in contact with her about a reversed charge.&nbsp; She recently asked me to take down this claim so she should secure a loan to pay me back.&nbsp; I did&#039;t think that fair to try to get my money back by enabling her to scam someone else so I did not take this&nbsp; down.&nbsp; If she returns the BTC or pays by other means I&#039;d be glad to delete this thread.&nbsp; She has been in contact with me, but evidently does not have to funds to repay.&nbsp; I did not give a loan so with regards to this transaction she is a scammer.&nbsp; Again if she repays me I&#039;d be glad to delete this thread.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also have additional personally identifying information that I will release here and/or use for further attempts to collect this debt.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I thought it was id theft for a while but when the geolocation data exactly matched the home address listed on her IL driver&#039;s license, ie she took a photo of her license in her home, it&#039;s now highly unlikely (but you never know).&nbsp; We&#039;ll let the proper authorities figure out the rest.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks matauc12,<br /><br />The point is accountability.&nbsp; If these scammers know we&#039;ll hunt their scummy asses down they are less likely to troll here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The bottom line is DO NOT SEND YOU FUNDS (BTC, FIAT or otherwise) off in to the ether with out knowing who you are trading with.&nbsp; That way you can track them down when things go wrong.<br /><br />I&#039;m all for anonymous transactions and frankly it is really no ones business who is trading with who and how much they trade. <br /><br />Unfortunately it is the scammers who use this as a guise to rob you.&nbsp; <br /><br />And as firstlady0524, found out&nbsp; ( and jermaine will find out shortly) it is pretty must impossible to be autonomous on the internet anymore.<br /><br />We will find you!<br /><a href="http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b300/spacemonkey_fg/More%20Random%20Pics/Falling9-1.jpg">http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b300/spacemonkey_fg/More%20Random%20Pics/Falling9-1.jpg</a><br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

Start a new thread to collect relevant (non-vigilante) information and I will certainly take a look at it.<br /><br />No one is anonymous on the internet. &nbsp;Just ask the Anonymous kids sitting in prison cells right now (except maybe th3j35t3r and he&#039;s surely on the NSA or some other black budget payroll so you can be sure they are protecting him).<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">EDIT - what a performance, after filing a police report, in her supposed area, They contacted me and said they cant do anything with the information as I am not a resident of her country, I was told to file it at my local police and international liaison officer&#039;s will be able to enforce it, So going to do that shortly, YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS!!&nbsp; ;D &lt;--A grin because police told me it IS classed as theft!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">She has *slowly* been making payments to me. &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure squall1066 is having as much luck.<br /><br />If she can&#039;t keep up we&#039;ll have to release her dox again on online and on her social networks.<br /><br />Squall1066, I could &quot;assume&quot; your debt and file a small claim here in the states on your behalf.<br /><br />We could do it Monday.<br /></div>
