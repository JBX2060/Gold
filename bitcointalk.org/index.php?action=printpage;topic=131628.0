					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When I was born, my grandparents made me a small fund, it was stocks in a Norwegian Bank. The same thing they did to all my other sisters and brothers. The idea was that when I was old enough, I could use this money for education, or any other suitable purpose. As history would have it, the stocks decreased in value, and my grandparents never sold out. Eventually it was all lost, as the stocks were written down to zero.<br /><br />I was thinking, and I mentioned this to my better half at one point, but she seemed indifferent (she&#039;s indifferent to everything that has to do with bitcoin) that perhaps we should start a &#039;fund&#039;, ie. just invest in bitcoins and not touch it until we have children that&#039;s old enough to have any possible advantage of it, i.e. perhaps 20 years into the future at this point.<br /><br />Obviously we would not invest more than we could stand to lose.<br /><br />I figure it can&#039;t fare any worse than the bank stock investments of my grandparents...<br /><br />I&#039;m seriously thinking this may be an interesting idea. What do you all think of it, and how would you make sure that the wallet survived all these years ? Would this be something you would do for your children or grandchildren ? Possibly, bitcoin may fail, and it might become worthless, on the other hand, if bitcoin becomes a mad success and lives on in a couple more decades, who knows what kind of prices we&#039;d be looking at.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i think its a great idea but we/they have to stop bringing up the asinine idea about raiding/pillaging old unused addresses.&nbsp; &nbsp;no one knows if those would represent what you&#039;re recommending vs. real lost private keys.</div>

If I or anyone else wants to sit on some coins for the remainer of our lifetime, we should be free to do so. If they were forcefully removed after 1,5,10 or even 20 years, who on earth would be around thinking that &#039;oh - we need to move the coins before they expire!&#039;. And we would have lot&#039;s of cases were people go to retrieve their btc, and it&#039;s expired. Very silly idea to implement anything like that.</div>

However, a variety of factors discussed in the sources cited in FAQ 15, below, may result in a much shorter life span for CDs/DVDs. Life expectancies are statistically based; any specific medium may experience a critical failure before its life expectancy is reached. Additionally, the quality of your storage environment may increase or decrease the life expectancy of the media. We recommend testing your media at least every two years to assure your records are still readable.<br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">furthermore, when you hit enter after interpreting and typing the 144 printed letters into Armory and it says &quot;error&quot; it doesn&#039;t tell you which of the 144 letters was wrong.&nbsp; so you have to keep guessing which one.&nbsp; could take you a lifetime... ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would like to revisit this issue.<br /><br />I have allocated a certain sum that if lost completely is a loss that will not stop me from sleeping at night.<br /><br />Thus, the idea is to convert this sum into bitcoins. I understand that I can generate a private key (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key) and corresponding bitcoin address on an air gapped computer. Then I thought it would be a great idea to &nbsp;ingrave the private key to a metal plate, a ring or something similar, perhaps along with some short instructions. Ie. &quot;BTC redeemable, privkey: <b>5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF</b>&quot;. I&#039;ve also seen that a minikey (eg. <b>SzavMBLoXU6kDrqtUVmffv</b>) can be used. But I feel that the longer Wallet import format works better, as I for some reason picture it would be safer.<br /><br />By the end of the day, if this project fail, then so be it - and I made a shot and lost. No regrets.<br /><br />Is there any &#039;guarantee&#039; (in the sense we can talk about it), that as long as bitcoin exist the Wallet import format will always be supported? Perhaps some new format will come in the future, but will there still be some backwards compability?<br /><br />If we look at a time fram of say 20 years, this can make for a very interesting story when the coins are finally redeemed. Is it possible, what would the value increase (or decrease) be, and on what device and which software program would it be redeemed. Also, I feel that inprinting it on a metal piece would make for better durability. &nbsp;It could be ingraved on something similar to this:<br /><br /><a href="http://img.costumecraze.com/images/vendors/franco/30109-Deluxe-Metal-Dog-Tag-Necklace-large.jpg">http://img.costumecraze.com/images/vendors/franco/30109-Deluxe-Metal-Dog-Tag-Necklace-large.jpg</a><br /><br />I am sure no other family members have the slightest clue about what I am on about, but I&#039;m willing to try, and I think it is a great idea. What do you think, and is there something you&#039;d like to add apart from what&#039;s already said ?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would store the wallet with instructions on how to use it on a variety of media. &nbsp;Paper, CDR, and DVDR.&nbsp; Anything using flash memory is guaranteed to lose data within about 10 years.&nbsp; The smaller the cells and higher density of data, the faster the data loss.<br /><br />Hexadecimal format on acid free paper printed with a laser printer. &nbsp;Store in multiple locations. &nbsp;Same with CDR/DVDR. &nbsp;Buy several different brands and types of discs (organic dye medium). &nbsp;Beware of OEMs making many different brands. &nbsp;You may buy 5 brands thinking they&#039;re different when really they&#039;re identical. &nbsp;A couple of discs may fail but the chances of all failing, across all types in all locations is very slim. &nbsp;My first CDRs burned on Kodak gold discs are still readable more than 15 years later.<br /><br />Finding a place to store the wallet securely and making sure that the recipients find it will be your greater problems. <br /><br />The greatest problems: people losing interest in bitcoin because something better comes along. &nbsp;In the 20 year period money is transfered to the new system. &nbsp;The left over bitcoins are worthless as there&#039;s no one left to trade them with. &nbsp;A change in hashing protocol rendering your bitcoins worthless is also a big risk. &nbsp;Hashing algorithms come and go as vulnerabilities are found. &nbsp;MD5 was once considered very good for example.<br /><br />Play with the idea and maybe set aside some bitcoins as a fun experiment, but I wouldn&#039;t invest serious amounts of money.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bitcoin has been around for 4 years, less than that in a usable software form.&nbsp; It would be interesting to load up a wallet with bitcoins and store it for maybe, 5 years, before retrieval.&nbsp; It&#039;s long enough to be a really long time in terms of bitcoin, but also short enough that you&#039;ll avoid media degredation worries or simply forgetting about the whole thing.<br /><br />In addition to my previous post, if you were serious about storing bitcoins for children or grand children it would be well worth storing a couple of DVD drives with the discs.&nbsp; In a decade or two you may have difficulty finding a working drive even if your media is all fine.&nbsp; A USB DVD drive isn&#039;t a bad idea as USB has been around for a very long time.&nbsp; I had a USB enabled PC in 1997, so it&#039;s fairly likely USB will be known and maybe even used in some form in a decade or two from now.&nbsp; Heck, it&#039;s still possible to buy new motherboards with serial and parallel ports, technology that dates back to the 1970s.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since I believe that there is a small chance of bitcoin becoming very very valuable, and a large chance of it becoming worthless, I would buy a small amount of coins, and put the rest of your savings for your children/grandchildren into other things (gold, real estate (if you are rich), stocks ..).<br />That way, if bitcoin makes it, it will provide your offspring with a good amount of wealth, but in the likely scenario that something goes wrong, the loss will be minimal, and they will still have the other things.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You could always laminate the paper, which would make it considerably more durable.&nbsp; That would essentially protect it from general degradation and water.&nbsp; It would obviously still be vulnerable to certain things (ie. theft, fire) but so would a coin.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Right, because telling a risk-adverse investor to invest his children&#039;s money into bitcoin (which has the relative safety of a roulette table) is sound investment advice.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t you just tell him to cash in his savings, go to Vegas, and put it all on black?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the higher potential yield of an investment, the higher the risk generally is. The individual investor need to decide how much risk they are willing to take on and weigh it versus the potential payoff.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that bitcoin or stocks (or any other investment vehicle for that matter) have no place in a portfolio, I am simply stating that investors that can&#039;t handle risk should look elsewhere.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t see how that is an unreasonable position.<br /><br /><br /></div>
