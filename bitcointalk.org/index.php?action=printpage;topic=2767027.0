					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been receiving several emails recently soliciting for investment is Crypto coin Ponzi scheme scam, it seems high end because you will find it listed on coinmarketcap but with no figures. Reading through I found out that its scam has been running for the past 2-3years but nothing yes has been done about it. Every wise man should stay way from Swiss coin {SIC} and Onecoin.<br />Below is how there spam format looks like<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">&quot;It&#039;s probably not news to you at this point if I tell you that bitcoin has made tons of people tons of money. Something else you probably already know is that it will never go up like crazy again. Its time to shine is long gone. That&#039;s why we must look into what the next big thing is, and the truth is that there have been plenty over the last few months. Can you jump on the next huge one before it soars? Swiss coin {SIC} is the most likely candidate for a fifty thousand percent return this year. It has the support of the Switzerland government. It is already considered as legal in the country. It&#039;s the type of coin that you can buy a thousand bucks of right now, sit on for a small period of time and you could make out crazy wealthy when all is said and done. SIC has already doubled since Saturday. This long Martin Luther King weekend could bring you even more upside if you act quickly. For those of you who know what this means&#65533; you can get it for under 50 satoshi right now. And if you have no clue what this means, it basically means that you can get in on the ground floor How do you get some? You just need an account at coinexchange.&quot;&quot;</div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the heads&nbsp; up. Just curious, what happened to their Twitter account https://twitter.com/SwisscoinSic<br /><br />Looks like it&#039;s gone now. And they don&#039;t even have an ANN thread on Bitcointalk. Hmm</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes. Swisscoin is NOT a scam.<br /><br />It&#039;s taken awhile for the right people to come together for it, but it&#039;s finally happening. The CEO that didn&#039;t give a crap about the coin has been removed from the CEO position and someone who actually cares about the coin has taken his place.<br /><br />Swisscoin project is finally heading in the right direction. Don&#039;t miss it. It&#039;s not going to be huge, but if you invest now while it&#039;s cheap, you will get a nice profit in the next couple of years.<br /><br />Get it now while you can.. don&#039;t make me come back in a year and say &quot;See, I told you so!&quot;</div>
