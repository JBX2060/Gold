					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi,<br />might as well do my introduction with a proper post.<br /><br />So I got an XFX 7970 Gigahertz edition, double dissipation. non-reference board with two dvi, hdmi and two dp ports. No bios switch too.<br /><br />The sticker on the board says: 797G-TD&nbsp; FX-797G-TDF VA1<br />GHZ DD RADEON XT2 1050M WITH BOOST<br /><br />Atiflash product name: Tahiti B0 XT2 C38620 GDDR5 3GB 500e/150m<br />BIOS P/N: 113-797TDF70-101<br />BIOS ver: 015.022.000.001.000000<br />BIOS date: 07/18/12<br /><br />No matter how I configure cgminer I can only get ~520kh/s out of the card.<br /><br />Reading around, it seems a different BIOS would help, so I tried a bunch with crappy results.<br />None of the XFX ones will even boot, gigabyte won&#039;t load drivers, sapphire will load drivers but crashes. All were different 7970 BIOSes.<br />I tried one xfx r9 280x but that one wouldn&#039;t even flash for some reason (flashing failed).<br /><br />I welcome any suggestion as to what BIOS might work for this card.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello!<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest trying playing with different switches in cgminer. I have 2 280xs which are basically 7970s. Here is what you should try: --gpu-engine 1098,1084 --gpu-memclock 1500,1500 --thread-concurrency 11200 -I 13. First i set gpu-memclock to 1500 which helped me to get above 600 then, thread concurrency, then set gpu-engine clock and try a few values between 1050-1100, and wait a few seconds for the hashrate to stablize. Hope this help, i&nbsp; don&#039;t think flashing new bios will help. Also try it on a fresh windows, it helped me a lot too. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Without any overclock, a 7970 should be getting more than 520 khash/s easily. I have a 7950 boost (925/1250) and I&#039;m getting more than 520 khash/s.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have the same problem With XFX 7970 DD Ghz card too. It has 2 dvi ports.<br /><br />The sticker says:<br /><br />FX - 797A - TD FX- 797A - TDBC V3.1 <br /><br /><br />Any got a suggestion to a BIOS that Works and gives good hashing?<br /><br /><br />-edit:<br /><br />This bios Works:<br /><br />http://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/133826/gigabyte-hd7970-3072-121106.html<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have this same exact card OP, and I can&#039;t get any BIOS to flash.&nbsp; I tried using ATIflash in dos, and unlocking the BIOS then using /f switch.&nbsp; No go.<br /><br />Winflash fails as well.<br /><br />I can&#039;t even get it to top 450 most of the time :(<br /><br /></div>
