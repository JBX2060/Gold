					Post by: <b>doghouse</b> on <b>February 11, 2013, 10:36:18 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is a newbie question...<br /><br />I&#039;ve installed bitcoin-qt and Armoury on on a PC. After ages, (more than 8 hours) the blockchain is still downloading. (Last received block generated 175 days ago).<br />Instead of going through the same rigmarole again on another PC, can I install bitcoin-qt, and move the files from C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin to the new installation?<br /><br />Which files do I need?<br />Are <i>blk0001.dat</i>, <i>blk0002.dat </i>and <i>blkindex.dat</i> enough? (I don&#039;t need to move my wallet.dat)<br /><br />Can they just be &quot;dropped into place&quot;, or is there a command line option I need to use to make it recognised?<br /><br />Many Thanks!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, that are the files you need, just copying the should be sufficient. But as you are not finished yet anyway, I would suggest, that you upgrade to v0.8 instead.<br /><br />This Version uses ultraprune and reduces the download time for the blockchain to a few hours.<br /><br />The final version is not out yet, but you can download the release candidate here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=142151.0</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks everyone for your help!<br />In the end, I installed v0.8 and then re-downloaded the Blockchain from scratch using the <i>-dbcache=2000</i> parameter. This was much quicker than on the previous version of bitcoin-qt. Unfortunately, it and Armory takes up a lot of RAM though!</div>

I may not have been clear in may previous post.&nbsp; When you move the blockchain files, you move them to the bitcoin directory and REPLACE the other blockchain files.&nbsp; You do NOT run the client so that is updates its blockchain files from the new ones.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello All,<br /><br />I can confirm that it is possible to copy the block chain from a Windows v0.8.1-beta installation to a linux v0.8.1-beta by copying only the contents (including subdirectories) of &#039;blocks&#039; and &#039;chainstate&#039; folders.<br /><br />Matt</div>

You feel entitled to bother a lead developer for your own personal tech support? I have a feeling this is one reason why Satoshi was no longer entertained with the forum.</div>

Do you know if it is possible to copy the 0.8 blockchain to a new computer by simply pasting the blocks and chainstate directories? Any further info on whether such a transfer would work cross-platform or not?<br /></div>Sadly, apparently no one here knew the correct answer or could be bothered to share it. I decided to try my best to find out and share the answer so that others could benefit. With the blockchain well over 7.5GB and growing fast, it is important that users know how to copy the blockchain correctly.</div>
