There should nothing be ignored, you&#039;re right but if people would just focus on the thought that they will gain money by simply trading the coin, really a coin is doomed. The thoughts and perception of people should change into using webn. Instead of having great tradings or listings, the team should maybe focus more on web partnerships to prove their legitimacy. Webn should be a team that lives its whitepaper and i&#039;m hoping they will. I have put enough trust, time and money investment on this project! Tot he moon!</div>
