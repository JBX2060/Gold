					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you have one client, add 1 bitcoin to it, save the wallet. Then a week later, add another bitcoin, and save that wallet.<br /><br />After that, you setup two clients. One with the newer wallet, the other with the older wallet.<br /><br />Is there danger of wallet corruption?<br /><br />Or will one wallet painlessly acknowledge the disappearance of a bitcoin if the other wallet sells it? There will be no synchronizing problems the network saying the bitcoin is in two different wallets?<br /><br />thanks in advance for answering this most probably stupid question</div>

As an analogy you can think of them as three &quot;coins&quot;, one stamped 5 BTC, one stamped 8 BTC, and one stamped 10 BTC. &nbsp;Lets assume for the moment that the client chooses to spend the 5 BTC output for the 2 BTC transaction that you are creating. . . &nbsp;<br /><br />It creates a transaction that uses the previous 5 BTC output as an input. &nbsp;Also included in the transaction is at least one new output of 2 BTC to the address you are sending to. &nbsp;In this case, what happens to the remaining 3 BTC? &nbsp;If the total of all the inputs in a transaction is higher than the total of all the outputs, then the difference is kept by the miner that adds the transaction to a block. &nbsp;This is how transaction fees work.<br /><br />Since you probably don&#039;t want to pay a 3 BTC transaction fee for this transaction, you&#039;ll want/need a second output in this transaction to do something with that extra 3 BTC. &nbsp;The way the Bitcoin-Qt wallet handles this is to grab a new unused bitcoin address from its address pool and include a second output in the transaction sending this 3 BTC to that new address. &nbsp;Since this isn&#039;t an address that you requested in the user interface it doesn&#039;t show this address to you in the &quot;Receive Coins&quot; tab. &nbsp;It keeps it entirely hidden from you. &nbsp;The wallet is aware that it sent the bitcoins to the address so it knows to include the amount of bitcoins associated with the address in the balance that it shows you. &nbsp;It also knows that it can pull the 3 BTC output from that address when creating a new transaction in the future if needed.<br /><br />Since the wallet just used an address from the addres pool, it must now create a new address to add to the address pool. &nbsp;This new address is entirely random. &nbsp;There is no way for the other copy of your wallet to know what this address is, and no way for it to generate the same address for itself. &nbsp;As the client slowly uses up the addresses that were in the address pool at the time that you made the copy, eventually all the addresses in the address pool are new and the other copy of the wallet isn&#039;t aware of any of them. &nbsp;The next time that you send a transaction, <b>the change goes to an address that only one copy of the wallet knows about. &nbsp;The bitcoins simply vanish from the other wallet</b>.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">That is just one example of the type of odd behavior you can expect</span>.<br /><br />It is possible for 2 blocks to be solved by 2 different miners at nearly the same moment. &nbsp;It is possible for a transaction that you send (or receive) to only be included by one of those miners. &nbsp;If this happens, it is possible that one copy of the wallet will receive the block from one miner, and the other copy will receive the block from the other miner. &nbsp;One wallet will show 1 confirmation, the other will show 0 confirmations. &nbsp;Eventually the network will work out which block will become the &quot;real&quot; block, and the confirmations will match between the 2 wallets, but until one of the blocks is orphaned, your multiple copies of wallets won&#039;t show the same number of confirmations.<br /><br /><br />There is other odd behavior, and problems you can create for yourself (accidental double-spend attempts for example). &nbsp;It is not a good idea to actively use copies of the same Bitcoin-Qt wallet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey, thanks for that detailed response.<br /><br />I had to break that up into bits and pieces to make sure I had it right, but I think I understand it now.<br /><br />So what you&#039;re saying is there&#039;s a pool of limited &#039;&#039;hidden&#039;&#039; addresses the Bitcoin desktop client uses to store whatever&#039;s left from whatever someone paid the client at any given moment of time.<br /><br />Can&#039;t thank you enough for warning me about that particularity.<br /><br />How many hidden addresses are in the pool, btw? You&#039;re saying that at any given moment in time, a wallet has a limited amount of hidden addresses, and that if we spend from a copy of the wallet, the other copy won&#039;t see the hidden address and the cash that was left over. But that it will only apply if the number of hidden addresses have gone beyond the ones available the time the cold wallet was created.<br /><br />Does this flaw in any way apply to visible addresses? Say you stored a cold copy of the wallet, and only received outputs into the online wallet. As there are only new visible addresses, the kind we can see on the desktop client, and the client has only been receiving outputs, not spending anything, will there be no problem if the cold wallet is then used on another operating system with another desktop client, not to start combining the use of the two as you say that&#039;d be insecure, but just to show up on the cold wallet the outputs received by the other wallet and to never use the other wallet again?<br /><br />What about these other instances, can there be funny business in them too:<br /><br />Can a bitcoin-qt crash a computer because it&#039;s somehow detecting another bitcoin-qt on the same NAT, or something the client does overloads the RAM or the block updates are hitting a sensitive part of the hard drive that may be half broken?<br /><br />If I haven&#039;t spent any outputs, just putting the wallet dat in another computer will bring no issues? What about if the client with this said wallet is crashing and hasn&#039;t seen a recent version of the blockchain update, will it still update the new bitcoin-qt on the new pc with its balance?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I really don&#039;t understand why you want to try to run two copies of the same wallet. &nbsp;The example I gave is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just one example</span> of how and why you might experience &#039;weird behaviour&#039;. &nbsp;<b>This client is not designed to be running multiple copies simultaneously</b>. &nbsp;You won&#039;t hurt the network or anyone else, but you most likely will create a mess for yourself, and unless you understand all the inner workings and are very careful, you will probably eventually end up permanently losing some bitcoins.<br /><br />Depending on what you are trying to do, you might find that you can accomplish it better with an Armory or Electrum wallet. &nbsp;You also may want to look into using a web based wallet like https://blockchain.info/wallet<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130793.msg1474726#msg1474726">Quote from: chufchuf on January 24, 2013, 02:20:08 AM</a></div><div class="quote">So what you&#039;re saying is there&#039;s a pool of limited &#039;&#039;hidden&#039;&#039; addresses the Bitcoin desktop client uses to store whatever&#039;s left from whatever someone paid the client at any given moment of time.<br /></div>It sounds like you probably understood that part.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130793.msg1474726#msg1474726">Quote from: chufchuf on January 24, 2013, 02:20:08 AM</a></div><div class="quote">How many hidden addresses are in the pool, btw?<br /></div>There are two pools of hidden addresses:<br /><br />The addresses that are currently being used to hold the change from previous transactions are hidden. &nbsp;The quantity of addresses hidden in this way will be less than (or equal to) the total number of outgoing transactions.<br /><br />There is also a pool of hidden unused addresses. &nbsp;This is the list of addresses that the client chooses from whenever it needs a new address. &nbsp;So if you click the &quot;New Address&quot; button in the user interface of the wallet, it gets the address from this hidden pool. If it needs a new address to store the change from a transaction, it also gets that address from this pool. &nbsp;The size of this hidden pool is configurable, but the default is 100 addresses. &nbsp;Anytime the client removes an address from this pool, it randomly generates a new address and adds it to the pool as a replacement.<br /><br />This means that if you make two copies of your wallet and run both at the same time, and then start clicking on the &quot;New Address&quot; button in both copies simultaneously, the first 100 addresses that you receive will be identical in both wallets, but when you click the button the 101st time, you will get a different address in each copy of the wallet.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130793.msg1474726#msg1474726">Quote from: chufchuf on January 24, 2013, 02:20:08 AM</a></div><div class="quote">You&#039;re saying that at any given moment in time, a wallet has a limited amount of hidden addresses, and that if we spend from a copy of the wallet, the other copy won&#039;t see the hidden address and the cash that was left over.
