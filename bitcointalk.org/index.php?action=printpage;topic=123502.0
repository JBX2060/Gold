					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don&#039;t worry I&#039;m sure the transaction to BTC Jam will never become confirmed. So you are save to send it again.<br /><br />But I have no Idea how that could happen. Interested in the answer and watching this thread.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m not sure if this was a double spend received from btcjam or a double spend caused by sending from the wallet. But if this occurs again normally you just have to wait an hour or so for one of the transactions to confirm and things resolve themselves.</div>
