					Title: <b>Incentivizing Bitcoin Nodes</b><br />
					Post by: <b>RealBitcoin</b> on <b>July 02, 2016, 05:04:58 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One flaw I find in bitcoin is the lack of incentivizing nodes.<br /><br />The basic theory of bitcoin as I understand is like this: Miners are incentivized by fees + block reward to mine and thus establish the critical backbone of the network. Each miner must be a node, therefore there will be at least as many nodes as miners.<br /><br />Now in a perfectly decentralized system, everyone would be a node and a miner,and there would be no issue. However in reality, mining is a specialized industry and it gets more specialized as the day goes by. And nodes have no incentive, so the network is really on the mercy of the good will of the people who voluntarly run a full node non-profit. This is definitely a problem.<br /><br />Mining will become centralized that is inevitable, just as agriculture in the past 5000 years was practiced by 80% of the population, now it&#039;s only done by 1-2%, the same will happen with bitcoin mining. However bitcoin mining centralization is another topic, and the node count is even a bigger problem than that.<br /><br />So the miners will be less and less even with the incentives. But what about the nodes? They have 0 incentive, so the problem here is even greater , <b>and I fear that in the next years the node could will drastically shrink making the network very insecure.<br /></b><br /><hr /><br />-Merchants will hardly be nodes, they will just use a paid API given by a specialized hosting node service, that will be just like any major hosting provider.<br /><br />-Individual users, wont even bother to run a full node, because the hardware requirement will be big, and they will just use lightweight or web wallets<br /><br />-Miners will be nodes, but the question is how long until they develop a tech where they will use a centralized node hosting service and they will only supply the mining power to it.<br /><br /><hr /><br />So the conclusion is that nodes are a dying species, there is absolutely no incentive for people to be nodes, and it will slowly shrink and make bitcoin network very unsafe.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 25pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">My proposal to incentivize nodes</span></div><br />Obviously messing around with the protocol is not a good idea, so we cant change the protocol to include the nodes in the reward system (as it should have been done 95-5% split with miners and nodes). However we can do it offchain, with sidechains, smart-contracts or other technology. The following ideas came into my mind ,and some of them might be implemented, or even all of them, if they are suitable. All implementations would be optional, so if a node doesn&#039;t want to participate, he can opt-out.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>1) Donation pool for nodes</b></span><br /><br />A donation pool for nodes can be implemented, and each node can participate in it, voluntarly. Whereas people can donate into a pool, and the pool automatically forwards every donation to each node&#039;s bitcoin address. <br /><br />There would have to be a server or some kind of offchain solution to store the information, or some kind of smart contract system that executes the procedure&nbsp; automatically and transparently.<br /><br />So each node would receive a share of every donation, when somebody donates<br /><br />You can get inspiration from the approach of the Electrum wallet , whereas each electrum server has a donation address and people can donate there, the same can be done with bitcoin nodes, but automatically.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>2) For profit API system of nodes</b></span><br /><br />A node could delegate his access to the network to clients, as in server-&gt;client relation. Each node is a server so clients who dont want to run a full node, but do want access to the bitcoin network, could do it in an API system that they would pay for.<br /><br />So for example if Company A doesn&#039;t want to setup and maintain a bitcoin node, but wants to broadcast transactions securely direct to the network. They will pay a subscription fee to use the bitcoin nodes via an API system.<br /><br />So the API system could connect the access to the bitcoin node directly with a client, they would pay for it, and the nodes would then provide access to their service.<br /><br />However the catch is that the API access would be shared between all nodes, so the subscriber would not always connect 1 node, but to the node(s) closest to him or randomly, and the subscription fee would be equally distributed between all nodes proportional to their uptime %. This would ensure that all nodes get a piece of the pie, and would incentivize many people to just run a full node to earn some bitcoins.<br /><br />And not just broadcasting, but getting statistics from the network and others. Imagine it just like the blockchain.info API system (https://blockchain.info/api), but it would be for-profit and every node could do that.<br /><br />This is also need to be done via some sort of smart contract or offchain solution, but i think it&#039;s doable.<br /><br />Most nodes already limit the number of TX they allow, do prevent DDOS, so why not make broadcasting for profit and eliminate DDOS forever (because DDOS only happens when the access is free)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>3) Altcoin financing bitcoin nodes</b></span><br /><br />A POW inflationary altcoin can be created (BTCNODECOIN?), that will finance the nodes directly. It would inflate forever like dogecoin, and 50% of the mined coins would go directly as a donation to bitcoin nodes, to finance them. The other 50% would go to the altcoin miners just as usual. So the altcoin miners and nodes would share the reward, but the miners would do the work.<br /><br />So investors that would invest in this would directly support all bitcoin nodes, and this way people could support nodes.<br /><br />This is almost equivalent to 1) , however the altcoin approach instead of a donation pool is more self-sustainable. And the speculators + investors + donors is a better approach than just donors alone.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>4) kushti&#039;s proposal</b></span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1534271.msg15518097#msg15518097">Quote from: kushti on July 08, 2016, 08:45:12 PM</a></div><div class="quote">There are some consensus protocols adding rewards for full nodes to the Proof-of-Work, e.g. Proof-of-Activity by Bentov/Rosenfeld http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/452.pdf and a protocol of mine http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07926 (working on the new version of the paper right now, it will be more formalized)<br /></div><br /><hr /><br />So these are my ideas to restore the nodes. All implementations would be optional, so if a node doesn&#039;t want to participate or risk their network to vulnerabilities, he can opt out. But new nodes could come into existance as they become incentivized.<br /><br />Also I leave the technical part to developers and programmers to figure out, I just put out the idea , and the details can be discussed.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree, there should be some kind of financial incentive for node owners. Maybe 1% of fees should be given to nodes ? <br />But since this is not an actual problem, I really doubt anything will be done about it. In the future maybe, when nodes are rare.</div>

Do you seriously think that 100% of bitcoin users are loyal to bitcoin? Or care about bitcoin&#039;s long term? So the 1% is really as close as it gets.<br /><br /><b>For the 10 million bitcoin users you have only 5668 nodes, there is your proof how much the people care about bitcoin.</b><br /><br />Most of them cant even backup a wallet normally.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><b>So you need incentive to get more nodes, altruism can only provide 5668 nodes.</b></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Likely closer to 30k full nodes but ok. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Clearing_Up_Misconceptions_About_Full_Nodes#Myth:_There_are_only_about_5500_full_nodes_worldwide<br /><br />As long as the majority of the liquidity and investment capacity uses full nodes, we&#039;ll be okay. Kids buying $10 in bitcoin to spend on steam games don&#039;t matter much in terms of miners trying to print infinite bitcoins.<br /><br />Giving money to anyone running a node with an open port will incentivize sybil attacks, that&#039;s a serious problem with your proposal you haven&#039;t dealt with. It will be hard to convince people to give money to something that has this problem.</div>

If an enemy wants to destroy bitcoin , they buy up a bunch of VPS and do the sybil attack.<br /><br />If you give money to strangers, obviously multiple people, who dont know eachother, they will start hosting nodes.<br /><br />If the proposal is implemented well, to limit the profit to 1 IP/ 24hours, or some other limitation, then they wont spam the network up with nodes.<br /><br />However those people that dont host nodes currently, will start doing it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What&#039;s the point? Say if one person rents lots of hosting on many different subsets, then they use an SPV wallet for their actual bitcoin usage.<br /><br />Their nodes with open ports on rented hardware will do nothing to stop miners printing infinite bitcoins. The miners would just transfer their coins to an SPV wallet user and get goods and services in return.<br /><br />The real problem is economically-active wallets not being backed by full nodes.

They have an electrum server, which must be connected to their self hosted node, therefore 1 electrum server= 1 bitcoin node.<br /><br />https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-server<br /><br />So it is just like connecting to a bitcoin node, but through a 3rd party. You still have to trust the servers, but to my understanding, it connects to multiple ones to fetch the data ,so the probability of sybil attacks there is almost the same.<br /><br />What&#039;s your take on that?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We&#039;d need a way to verify that these full nodes are really full nodes to be rewarded. We should find some way of having a full node perform some work to prove they&#039;re not just a fake node. Maybe they could perform some sort of mathematical computations to prove they&#039;re real. And then when they find the right solution to this mathematical problem, we reward them with, say, 25 bitcoins. I think this would work. People would love such a reward and so they will run lots of full nodes!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just figure out a way to require those providing hashing power for the network to run a full node (in other words convince people to be actual Bitcoin miners instead of hash rate providers).<br /><br />Sure, mining might tend to centralize, but it would be far less centralized if there were no mining pools. So, instead of incentivizing full nodes, disincentivize mining pools.<br /><br />How one accomplishes that, I have no idea, but I strongly believe that this single step would lead to huge improvements to the health of the Bitcoin network. As a side effect, you would have a larger group of people who are &quot;experts&quot; at running a full node (which would help when it comes to making important decisions about the network in general).</div>

What then needs to happen is not for it to be replaced with higher bribes to maintain profits, but with clean nodes that include transactions for free to drive out the rent-seekers that have been paid handsomely already for establishing the network.<br /></div><br />Still it has to have some kind of incentive, if not monetary then what?<br /><br />How do you incentivize full nodes to be created, by individuals, and limit it to 1 / person?<br /><br />&nbsp;That is the real question.</div>

It&#039;s most probably even for an own BIP.&nbsp; I have a crude concept for that in my mind and it could use more elaboration through discussion.<br /><br />IMHO one could start off even more primitively: Announce bounty, negotiate sender, receive blocks, send bounty. In case the receiving node would not fullfill it&#039;s promise, ban it. That way it could &quot;rip off&quot; data from the network but at the cost to land in some banlists - which kind of counters the desire of priorization.

That requires most of the economy to be backed by full nodes which verify all the consensus rules, they have the same behavior in this respect whether they have open ports or not.<br /><br />We know for sure that it&#039;s very easy to spin up thousands of nodes: http://i.imgur.com/CVFPj6a.png<br /><br />https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/499bai/51_of_bitcoin_classic_nodes_hosted_on_aws/<br />https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44syq6/start_a_classic_node_in_aws_in_under_20_minutes/<br />https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/45zluh/growth_in_classic_nodes_almost_completely_fake/<br />https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4aka3f/over_3000_classic_nodes/d113ffi<br /><br />These links show that a small number of people were responsible for this.

While they continue to use a web wallet for their actual bitcoin transactions. These people are fundamentally confused about the main job of full nodes.<br /><br />I&#039;m perfectly confident to say that bandwidth is not at all a problem, and probably never will be for the foreseeable future. The real problem is the lack of widespread consensus verification, which Bitcoin &quot;Classic&quot; attempted to exploit to force a hostile hard fork, which is why I wrote the article.<br /><br />I see you&#039;ve added some words about miners using the p2p network to propagate blocks, future solutions like BIP152. From what I know most miners directly connect to each other&#039;s IPs because they would not be remotely competitive (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6kibPzbrIc) if they used the p2p network. The main bottleneck here isn&#039;t bandwidth so adding more peers to the p2p network won&#039;t improve it. The main bottleneck today is mostly verification time since hashing and ECDSA can take long.</div>

It needs to be solved, if it&#039;s possible. We don&#039;t need miners requiring centralized methods, if possible. Maybe someone has made an argument elsewhere that a centralized solution for this particular issue will always be more economically preferable/efficient than a p2p one, and, thus, any p2p solutions to it should not be developed? Such a conclusion (not saying it&#039;s yours) doesn&#039;t seem to follow, at least in my mind. We still need more efficient p2p options to fall back on *even* if centralized options for certain aspects of the network will remain economically superior.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How about this; Put a &quot;transaction redistributor&quot; layer in wallets, so that users can either choose miners to send their transactions to, maybe simply based on presumed geographical node positions and hashrate, or else have a third party handle it for them. The third party is trusted to have them mined in a decentralized manner. They might certify miners, in order to verify non-collusion, but how the third party ensures decentralization is open to competition.<br />If the transaction doesn&#039;t verify over a certain period of time, or if users no longer trust a third party for any reason, users could always fall back to standard broadcasting of transactions. This way, users can try enforcing a decentralized mining process, even though it would mean slower confirmation times, and slightly more expensive fees.<br />For this to have any chance of working, miners would have to be primarily funded through transaction fees. I find that interesting because it&#039;s a separate reason why funding miners through inflation is improper, and why a robust fee market is desirable. I previously disliked funding through inflation only because a good medium of exchange should have a stable supply, for easier economic calculation, and the inflation rate isn&#039;t found through a market process.<br /><br />I think this would be a difficult product to get users to adopt, because there doesn&#039;t appear to be any immediate benefit to them. It is also hard to establish trust with a third party, due to the nature of it being surprisingly difficult to prove nodes are decentralized, and therefore also difficult to ensure third parties are being effective.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is at least a method to incentivize decentralized nodes, and doesn&#039;t seem likely to make the situation worse.</div>

How many people who don&#039;t forward their ports are jumping at the chance to configure their setup to run as an HS?<br /><br />If, instead, HS support was fully automated, without the user even needing to install Tor -- say it was even turned on by default whenever an open port was not detected -- *that* would diminish the differences. Something like that might even be made to allow non-Tor outbound connections to run *concurrently* with HS connections so that there would be no substantial hit on bandwidth.<br /><br />I&#039;m not an expert, so, something like that could be an awful change for other reasons, but my point is that doing something like *that* is what I would categorize as moving closed port nodes, practically speaking, towards more comprehensive use by the network.</div>

Let&#039;s incentivize only those.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">So again, how are they not full nodes?<br /></div><br />See above. Apparently we are talking about some other name now. Because there clearly is a difference between &quot;full nodes&quot; and &quot;more full nodes&quot;. And if you - just for a second - forgot about nitpicking and remembered the true reason why we have this discussion in the 1st place (ensuring a robust network), you would probably start to see value in the &quot;more full nodes&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Actually they could be used in a sybil attack against one node, where those fake nodes take up all of the connections of a node and serve that node an alternate blockchain.<br /></div><br />True. How is that different from the situation today? Does &quot;incentive&quot; make a difference there?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Furthermore, there could be fake nodes that relay, but don&#039;t check. They could just be extra bandwidth that sends blocks and transactions around, but it isn&#039;t helpful if those fake nodes are not checking the blocks and transactions to make sure that they are valid. So they pretend to be a full node, but aren&#039;t actually doing the job a full node is supposed to.<br /></div><br />Actually those nodes would do more harm than good, because without dropping invalid tx they could cause kind of epileptic brainstorm to the bitcoin network, where a malevolent attacker would feed invalid tx and rely on these nodes to amplify his spam.<br /><br />How about this:<br /><br />I will call the nodes that IMHO would deserve an incentive &quot;pillar nodes&quot;. These are nodes, that<br /><br />a) can bootstrap any other node, i.e. carry all blocks<br />b) do validate transactions<br />c) maybe some more requirements about throughput/latency...<br />d) are available 24/7 (or sufficiently close to it)<br /><br /><br />Let me compare the situation to the electric grid. A blackout is a bad thing. Even more so, because there can be a cascade of events leading to a blackout in some geographically extensive area. Some power plants and/or grid lines go down, causing overload, causing shutdowns, causing more shutdowns. Nearly ALL modern power plants cannot start without power.<br /><br />There are some, that can. I know of a hydroelectric power plant that is designated to be able to start up a nuclear power plant in case everything else (grid, generators, ...) went black. Because hydroelectric power plants can start delivering power &quot;into the night&quot;.<br /><br />I hope it is clear where I am heading with this.<br /><br />In the early days of Bitcoin, a &quot;full node&quot; actually meant a node containing ALL blocks. It meant validating transactions. It even meant mining. The only thing it never meant was 24/7.<br /><br />People did run full nodes, because it was not a big deal (I had a 200GB HDD in 2010 and the blockchain was like 1 GB in 2012) and there was an incentive: mining This incentive is now gone, the blockchain today is 85GB and I have purged my wallet to my home server, because I will certainly not let it occupy my quite expensive 512GB NVMe SSD.<br /><br />Running a node similar to what it used to be back then (= not crippled) has become a PITA nowadays. You basically have one core constantly busy, around 750GB of monthly traffic, and 85GB of disk space, constantly rising.<br /><br />How long do you expect this will go on with people running &quot;nodes like that&quot; for free?<br /><br />If your answer to this problem is &quot;then don&#039;t run nodes like that&quot; (which at the moment I&#039;m afraid is just what you&#039;re saying), then unfortunately you&#039;re advocating Bitcoins demise in the long term.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">There is a deanonymization because there is a list of nodes that have relayed the transaction. The issue comes in with the node that created the transaction. That node would be the first node to attach its fingerprint to the list. Thus all of its peers, when they receive the transaction, can see that only one node has relayed that transaction. It will also know which peer relayed that transaction with one node on its list so it knows the ip address of the person sending the Bitcoin in that transaction.<br /></div><br />Ok. I see that now. Even though the fingerprint does not contain the IP, it can be derived from the connection info. If you see above the lightweight/supernode concept that is e.g. with Mycelium - <b>that</b> is actually something that would ensure the senders anonymity in this case. Again, I&#039;m not advocating this. You have to trust someone, which is not quite the concept we would like to have.<br /><br />How about this:<br /><br />A &quot;pillar node&quot; is a node that<br /><br />a) has all blocks - can bootstrap anyone<br />b) verifies transactions<br />c) maybe some more requirements about throughput/latency...<br />d) is available &quot;24/7&quot; (say - at least 99% of the week)<br />e) is purely altruistic: does not have a wallet<br /><br />A corollary to e) would be &quot;full nodes containing a wallet cannot add any info to the tx&quot; - for their own good.<br /><br />Now if some &quot;pillar node&quot; got a tx without a fingerprint, it could be from the originating IP, but effectively all it knows is that the originating IP does have a wallet or (because that should be optional) simply forfeits any potential incentive or just relayed the tx from another wallet-node that did the transaction. The deanonymization problem should be gone with that.<br /><br /><br /><br />Rico</div>

It needs to be solved, if it&#039;s possible. We don&#039;t need miners requiring centralized methods, if possible. Maybe someone has made an argument elsewhere that a centralized solution for this particular issue will always be more economically preferable/efficient than a p2p one, and, thus, any p2p solutions to it should not be developed? Such a conclusion (not saying it&#039;s yours) doesn&#039;t seem to follow, at least in my mind. We still need more efficient p2p options to fall back on *even* if centralized options for certain aspects of the network will remain economically superior.<br /></div><br />Please say where you&#039;ve read that. I think it might be wrong, because this short talk has data which shows miners today would not be even remotely competitive if they used the p2p network: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6kibPzbrIc<br /></div><br />I get the impression, from what luke-jr has said, that it could be done, or at least needs to be tried. He could be wrong, of course. Some relevant comments of his:<br /><br />https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4r2mah/why_a_1mb_block_size_may_be_right_for_todays/d4y6iqi<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Yes, propagation time across the entire network needs to be well under 30 seconds for the p2p network to compete with centralised networks. For this, the average node needs to be capable of downloading, verifying, and uploading the block to 8 peers in maybe 4 or 5 seconds. Typical upload speeds are simply not good enough for this today.<br /><br />Compact block relay in 0.13 will hopefully improve it by using the local memory pool as a cache for transactions in blocks. So instead of downloading/uploading the full block, you can get away with only a few transactions the receiving node didn&#039;t cache (the rest cached during non-time-critical periods preceding the block being found). Essentially this brings the time constraint from 5 seconds to 8 or 9 minutes on average.</div><br />https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4u38yt/bitcoins_nervous_system_gets_an_upgrade_with/d5my5pe<br />(also make sure to read the replies from TheBlueMatt and klondike_barz)<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"> We should be working toward killing off centralised block relay networks, not improving them so miners are even more biased against using only the decentralised p2p network.<br /><br />In other words, these improvements should be used on the p2p network, not designed for use in a centralised backbone.</div></div>

Each miner must be a node, therefore there will be at least as many nodes as miners.<br /><br />Now in a perfectly decentralized system, everyone would be a node and a miner,and there would be no issue. However in reality, mining is a specialized industry and it gets more specialized as the day goes by. And nodes have no incentive, so the network is really on the mercy of the good will of the people who voluntarly run a full node non-profit. This is definitely a problem.<br /><br />Mining will become centralized that is inevitable, just as agriculture in the past 5000 years was practiced by 80% of the population, now it&#039;s only done by 1-2%, the same will happen with bitcoin mining. However bitcoin mining centralization is another topic, and the node count is even a bigger problem than that.<br /><br />So the miners will be less and less even with the incentives. But what about the nodes? They have 0 incentive, so the problem here is even greater , <b>and I fear that in the next years the node could will drastically shrink making the network very insecure.<br /></b><br /><hr /><br />-Merchants will hardly be nodes, they will just use a paid API given by a specialized hosting node service, that will be just like any major hosting provider.<br /><br />-Individual users, wont even bother to run a full node, because the hardware requirement will be big, and they will just use lightweight or web wallets<br /><br />-Miners will be nodes, but the question is how long until they develop a tech where they will use a centralized node hosting service and they will only supply the mining power to it.<br /><br /><hr /><br />So the conclusion is that nodes are a dying species, there is absolutely no incentive for people to be nodes, and it will slowly shrink and make bitcoin network very unsafe.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 25pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">My proposal to incentivize nodes</span></div><br />Obviously messing around with the protocol is not a good idea, so we cant change the protocol to include the nodes in the reward system (as it should have been done 95-5% split with miners and nodes). However we can do it offchain, with sidechains, smart-contracts or other technology. The following ideas came into my mind ,and some of them might be implemented, or even all of them, if they are suitable. All implementations would be optional, so if a node doesn&#039;t want to participate, he can opt-out.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>1) Donation pool for nodes</b></span><br /><br />A donation pool for nodes can be implemented, and each node can participate in it, voluntarly. Whereas people can donate into a pool, and the pool automatically forwards every donation to each node&#039;s bitcoin address. <br /><br />There would have to be a server or some kind of offchain solution to store the information, or some kind of smart contract system that executes the procedure&nbsp; automatically and transparently.<br /><br />So each node would receive a share of every donation, when somebody donates<br /><br />You can get inspiration from the approach of the Electrum wallet , whereas each electrum server has a donation address and people can donate there, the same can be done with bitcoin nodes, but automatically.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>2) For profit API system of nodes</b></span><br /><br />A node could delegate his access to the network to clients, as in server-&gt;client relation. Each node is a server so clients who dont want to run a full node, but do want access to the bitcoin network, could do it in an API system that they would pay for.<br /><br />So for example if Company A doesn&#039;t want to setup and maintain a bitcoin node, but wants to broadcast transactions securely direct to the network. They will pay a subscription fee to use the bitcoin nodes via an API system.<br /><br />So the API system could connect the access to the bitcoin node directly with a client, they would pay for it, and the nodes would then provide access to their service.<br /><br />However the catch is that the API access would be shared between all nodes, so the subscriber would not always connect 1 node, but to the node(s) closest to him or randomly, and the subscription fee would be equally distributed between all nodes proportional to their uptime %. This would ensure that all nodes get a piece of the pie, and would incentivize many people to just run a full node to earn some bitcoins.<br /><br />And not just broadcasting, but getting statistics from the network and others. Imagine it just like the blockchain.info API system (https://blockchain.info/api), but it would be for-profit and every node could do that.<br /><br />This is also need to be done via some sort of smart contract or offchain solution, but i think it&#039;s doable.<br /><br />Most nodes already limit the number of TX they allow, do prevent DDOS, so why not make broadcasting for profit and eliminate DDOS forever (because DDOS only happens when the access is free)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>3) Altcoin financing bitcoin nodes</b></span><br /><br />A POW inflationary altcoin can be created (BTCNODECOIN?), that will finance the nodes directly. It would inflate forever like dogecoin, and 50% of the mined coins would go directly as a donation to bitcoin nodes, to finance them. The other 50% would go to the altcoin miners just as usual. So the altcoin miners and nodes would share the reward, but the miners would do the work.<br /><br />So investors that would invest in this would directly support all bitcoin nodes, and this way people could support nodes.<br /><br />This is almost equivalent to 1) , however the altcoin approach instead of a donation pool is more self-sustainable. And the speculators + investors + donors is a better approach than just donors alone.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>4) kushti&#039;s proposal</b></span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1534271.msg15518097#msg15518097">Quote from: kushti on July 08, 2016, 08:45:12 PM</a></div><div class="quote">There are some consensus protocols adding rewards for full nodes to the Proof-of-Work, e.g. Proof-of-Activity by Bentov/Rosenfeld http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/452.pdf and a protocol of mine http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07926 (working on the new version of the paper right now, it will be more formalized)<br /></div><br /><hr /><br />So these are my ideas to restore the nodes. All implementations would be optional, so if a node doesn&#039;t want to participate or risk their network to vulnerabilities, he can opt out. But new nodes could come into existance as they become incentivized.<br /><br />Also I leave the technical part to developers and programmers to figure out, I just put out the idea , and the details can be discussed.<br /></div></div>

I give in &nbsp; ::)<br /><br />You have a distributed block chain in the cloud and you pay people to cache the blocks. When a client bootstraps or requires blocks, it has to pay for them. Full nodes have all the blocks and therefore are able to supply anyone whereas an SPV might cache only a few so will naturally be making less coin because they have less customers they can service. The incentive is to hold as many blocks in cache to maximise the number of &quot;customers&quot; buying blocks off of you. So the trade-off is earning power vs disk space allocated with a full block chain being the maximum. This also rewards the fastest nodes too because even a full nodes will need to get the latest block from somewhere. <br /><br />That incentivises people to run full nodes. It also inentivises the miners to run 1000 full nodes in their data centers and not ask your little laptop node for anything. :-\ It does give me me my distributed block chain, so there is that..<br /><br />Take a look at the BitSwap section of IPFS.(https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/papers/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf?raw=true (https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/papers/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf?raw=true)) section 3.4 &nbsp;wher ethey say that they would require a crypto currency. How convenient Bitcoin already is, eh?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">BitSwap operates as a persistent marketplace where node can acquire the<br />blocks they need, regardless of what files those blocks are<br />part of. The blocks could come from completely unrelated<br />files in the filesystem. Nodes come together to barter in the<br />marketplace.<br />While the notion of a barter system implies a virtual cur-<br />rency could be created, this would require a global ledger to<br />track ownership and transfer of the currency</div></div>

Most people own 1 mobile phone and most people do not own more then 3 or so. And it would probably not be profitable to get a farm full of mobile phones.<br /><br />I think it will be hard or impossible to do though, as there are so many different phones and even different operating systems for phones, and I think any algorithm that would work on all (or most) phones, would probably work better on an ASIC or on a computer.<br /><br />But even an algorithm that only works on computers would be better because even though large miners could get server rooms full of computers, they would still have much less of an unfair advantage as they have now.<br /><br />Bitcoin was meant to be &#039;easily&#039; mined by anyone who wants to. It needs to be at least somewhat accessible for everyone who wants to mine.</div>

The full nodes only need to confirm the maths is correct rather than find a new solution. That is very doable on mobile devices without burning legs. Mining is a much tougher nut to crack since the resources required are designed to be a limit on circumventing the security. If you could try to mine a single transaction once only, rather than many multi-megabyte blocks full of them, then it might be possible. This would require huge changes and the miners wouldn&#039;t allow it (because....money)<br /><br /></div>

However, more devs would definitely help because it is a large problem to solve. <br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Edit: This is a small summary upcoming development release in the dev&#039;s words:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1045373.msg16085975#msg16085975">Quote from: georgem on August 30, 2016, 09:14:17 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><br />First of all, the spreadwallet is now <b>a multicoin multiwallet that can operate in SPV and Fullnode mode.</b> &nbsp;8)<br /><br />In short, what you&#039;ll get is:<br /><br />- decentralized UTXO blockexplorer that works with the nodes you host locally (on your main computer or spread over your local network)<br />- multihost capabilities that allow you to run multiple nodes in your local network, remote controlling them with your spreadwallet.<br />- easy setup and control through SSH of all the raspberry pis in your local network. <br />- multiwallet support for many coins, immediate use of all those coins in SPV mode.<br />- support for many different styles of wallets (deterministic, non-deterministic, TREZOR and paperwallets)<br />- update of the spreadcoin daemon to newest bitcoin core codebase<br /><br /></div></div>

AMA.<br /><br />I have advocated for pegging spreadcoin to bitcoin using sidechains when the economics reach the right balance. It can then be a layer two approach similar to Lightning Network, but its purpose would be to generate revenues for Bitcoin full nodes. <br /><br />Proof of Bitcoin Node is first required to solve the sybil problem when you try any incentives model. Otherwise you end up paying fake nodes and Bitcoin gets zero benefit from having the additional full nodes supporting growth of the network.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Another proposal I&#039;ve contributed a little bit to is to be published soon(next week I hope but lets&#039; see). the idea is to make asymmetric scheme so miners store the full state and provide proofs of its transformation correctness, while fullnodes are just checking proofs without need in disk database and so random I/O operations so very efficiently. Fullnodes are getting the same security guarantees as now. The scheme isn&#039;t applicable to Bitcoin, as usually, as it is not possible to modify Bitcoin significantly. </div>

Don&#039;t quote me though. <br /><br />The truth is though, the Bitcoin devs don&#039;t really have to endorse this for it to work. The real issue is creating the cryptographic proof that there is one service node (a version of masternodes) to one real Bitcoin node so that positive contributors are being rewarded and not some people running fake nodes or what have you...<br /><br />It will perhaps be challenging, however, once it&#039;s done the network will be more or less self sustaining. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why would bitcoin developers jump on creating there own version of what Satoshi Nakamoto sent me in the previous email, months after they original email was recieved, as indicated in the previous posts? Because there is something to what he wrote to me - I am convinced this gut is legit!. Its because the email address I have for Satoshi is legit. Why would anyone continue to use the same email address that has been hacked? So it is rediculous to expect that he is still using satoshin@gmx.com because it was hacked along time ago and the domain was tranfered since his original publication. Most people change there email &nbsp;every 5-7 years anyways. BITCOIN is not as decentralized as most people think; the Chinese are essentially controlling the entire bitcoin mining operation. Mandatory Peer-to-peer qualified node requirements could level the playing field. Also, looking for details in the writing style won&#039;t really prove much since its pretty likely that his original whitepaper was proofread and edited before it was published - emails, on the otherhand, are generally produced with less careful &quot;attention to detail&quot;. Those early commenters who &quot;trolled&quot; his outline in the email that I previously posted, seem like they are &quot;out of touch&quot; now... Proof of Qualified Node or Proof of Bitcoin Node is all anyone is talking about now. This means there is soon going to be revolution in the way mining is handled.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In a perfect world, we would have altruism and millions of nodes, but unfortunately until we find a way to financially compensate the resources needed to keep a node running, it will remain rather low in count, but lets not forget its not only how many nodes there are, but how widespread they are (which is why big blocks are bad).</div>
