					Post by: <b>Shiver</b> on <b>September 28, 2012, 04:18:30 PM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I recently backed up my wallet then installed Bitcoin version v0.7.0beta.&nbsp; I encrypted the wallet, which it says is locked, and it&#039;s telling me the wallet is out of sync, which I presume it because I have zero connections.&nbsp; I read somewhere that I need to make sure port 8333 needs to be open, but I haven&#039;e changed anything about the router.<br /><br />I apologise in advance if this is a simple fix already on the forum, but I&#039;ve scanned around and cannot see anything about it.<br /><br />How do I get connections and let the wallet update?<br /><br />Regards<br />Paul</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One other point I forgot to mention is that the wallet is encrypted and currently locked.&nbsp; Do I need to unlock it somehow to allow it to resynch with the blockchain?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Forgive me for hijacking the thread, :-[ but under what circumstances does the the latest bitcoin client warn you that the wallet is out of sync? ???</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Clicking on the link you gave me allows me to see transactions on any of the countries listed.<br />I also have another copy of the app on a laptop which is still updating the block chain, so when that&#039;s finished I&#039;ll try replacing the wallet.dat with my actual wallet.dat and see what happens there.&nbsp; The desktop I&#039;m having issues with at the moment was always okay until I upgraded.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The latest version of Bitcoin has changed the way that previously connected clients are cached. In older versions, in the Bitcoin data directory, the file addr.dat contained a list of known peers so that you could quickly restart. The newest version of Bitcoin creates a file peers.dat that contains the same information. Perhaps one of these files is corrupted and the peer-to-peer component can&#039;t start correctly - deleting them both and restarting may be the solution.<br /><br />Antivirus (Microsoft security essentials) may have it&#039;s own crap firewall that doesn&#039;t let unapproved software make connections. Discover if any AV package has a firewall component and disable it.<br /><br />Did you put port forwarding rules into your router? It may be that your desktop PC was assigned a different IP address than was previously valid for the rules - remove any port forwarding and be happy with 8 connections.<br /><br />Finally, if there is an actual program fault when launching Bitcoin, it may be recorded near the end of the debug.log file or db.log file.</div>
