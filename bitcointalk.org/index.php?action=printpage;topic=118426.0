					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So I am having some real fun with this one, some numnuts in the Netherlands is trying to basically say that they are me in a contest held by BFL.&nbsp; This idiot posted my video and then made comments about it like he lost his account.&nbsp; Now if he is on here (which I could not find) I think he should get a scammer tag right now but if he is not on here and he joins our bitcoin community I can already vouch this guy is a bag of crap.&nbsp; Seriously what the hell is this guy thinking and really to chose my crappy video as the one he wanted to use, what a loser.&nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /><br />Here see what this dip shit is writing over at BFL:<br />https://forums.butterflylabs.com/showthread.php/37-Article-Contest-Post-a-video-Win-a-BFL-Single-SC!/page9<br /><br />What a jack off! &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The boy is 16. I wonder what his parents would say if one called them. It&#039;s not like the number isn&#039;t easily found. Or his soccer coach. Man, these soccer coaches, they&#039;re always up in your face about stuff. <br /><br />BTW, nice house, Kennard<br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/6cSb3.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/6cSb3.jpg</a></div>
