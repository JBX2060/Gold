					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nice idea, it makes me think about Papaly. But your site is better since you&#039;re doing the job for me by adding the links ;D<br />Since you&#039;re focusing on multiple coins (I see ETH for example) It could be nice to have a dedicated page for the respective coin. Because if you are listing 10 coins related websites, it will become a mess</div>

Also, my goal is just an all-in-one for sort of beginner guides and relevant links, not an all-in-one for everything; as that&#039;s definitely a lot of work for just one guy. Thanks for the suggestion though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know the thread is a little bit old but since you&#039;re active, I thought I would suggest a few changes:<br /><br /><b>Mixmers:</b> Remove Bestmixer as it has been seized.<br /><b>Tools:</b> Consider replacing earn.com with <b>coinb.in (https://coinb.in/#fees)</b>. I find it to be far more accurate and cheaper.<br /><b>Software Wallets (PC)</b>: Blockstream is not available for desktop I believe.<br /><br />For wallets and block explorers, maybe it&#039;s worth adding whether they support SegWit or not. (A red text between brackets would be good). Also, for web wallets, I don&#039;t think you should put Coinbase and Xapo there.<br /></div>
