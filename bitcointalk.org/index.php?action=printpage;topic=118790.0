					Title: <b>Imported private key</b><br />
					Post by: <b>auberon</b> on <b>October 16, 2012, 05:46:17 PM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This may be a strange question, so I&#039;ll explain my issue first:&nbsp; I have an online wallet, but I have run into issues using them, especially the fact I now can&#039;t seem to send any coins from it.&nbsp; It (supposedly) generates a block chain, but my balance does not get debited, and the receiver never gets the coins.&nbsp; (It receives just fine.)&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried it in different browsers and on different machines, so I&#039;m feeling confident the problem isn&#039;t me.&nbsp; That, along with the fact they periodcally have security certificate issues, has made me decide to install my own wallet on my computer.&nbsp; The thing is - I want to get my coins from the online wallet, but as just explained, I can&#039;t just send them to the new address, so I decoded the private key used by the online wallet and imported it into a new wallet in my software.&nbsp; I assumed the coins associated with that key would make their way through the chain and show up in my software&#039;s wallet, but apparently I am mistaken (at least, they haven&#039;t done so within 18 hours or so).<br /><br />Can someone explain how this works?&nbsp; It&#039;s my understanding that if you have the private key, you can send whatever bitcoins are associated with it.&nbsp; Even if the wallet I imported them into shows a balance of zero, can I still try to send the amount that <i>should</i> be there?&nbsp; Do I need to give it more time to &quot;see&quot; the coins in the wallet first?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The &quot;wallet.dat&quot; data file maintains a current balance for your addresses. Every time that a new block is downloaded, any payment to you is noted and the balance in addresses you own is updated in this local file.<br /><br />However, if your local client is in sync, having already downloaded the entire blockchain, and you then import a private key through a third-party utility, the Bitcoin client doesn&#039;t go back in history searching for old payments to this new address. You must close Bitcoin, and relaunch it with the command-line option &quot;<b>bitcoin-qt -rescan</b>&quot;. This will start up Bitcoin in a mode where for several minutes it will re-examine the blockchain and attempt to detect any missing payments to you to correct your balance.<br /><br /></div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When you send coins, the wallet needs to sign the inputs.&nbsp; If the wallet does not know what the inputs are, it cannot generate a transaction.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />If you&#039;re trying to send coins from a local wallet-- does that mean you&#039;ve imported the private key with pywallet?&nbsp; If so, use --rescan, like deepceleron mentioned.&nbsp; You should see a balance.<br /><br />Also - Have you looked up the address in blockchain.info to see if transactions are making it onto the network/blockchain?<br /><br />Not being able to send from an online wallet sounds a lot like the issue we discussed at: <br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=104641.msg1145818#msg1145818 (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=104641.msg1145818#msg1145818)</div>

Gox, Bitfloor), or accounts with specific merchants (e.g., your BTC account with bitZino, bitMit.net, etc.).<br /><br />None of these hosted wallets will provide you with the private key for your deposit addresses.<br /><br />Another type of online wallet is a hybrid EWallet where you hold the private keys but the service is used for the spend transactions. &nbsp;Examples of hybrid EWallets are Blockchain.info/wallet and StrongCoin. &nbsp; You can see your private keys for your addresses in your hybrid EWallet, and transfer these keys elsewhere.<br /><br />There are also mobile clients where the keys are stored on the mobile and not with a back-end host and the method of getting the private keys varies depending on the approach the mobile app uses.<br /><br />Which type of service are you using, a hosted (shared) EWallet or a hybrid EWallet? &nbsp;(or, for more specific assistance, what EWallet service specifically are you referring to?)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118790.msg1276413#msg1276413">Quote from: auberon on October 16, 2012, 05:46:17 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I decoded the private key used by the online wallet and imported it into a new wallet in my software.</div><br />&quot;Decoded&quot;? &nbsp;Do you simply mean that you copied the private key (or exported it) from a hybrid EWallet (e.g., Blockchain.info/wallet) and then imported that key into the Bitcoin.org client?<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Stephen, I use StrongCoin, and so yes, I was able to get my private key from them.&nbsp; The key is encrypted on their server, and so to obtain it they have a &quot;decode&quot; function that unencrypts it in my browser.&nbsp; I&#039;m then able to copy and paste.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t use pywallet to import the key because the client I&#039;m using (MultiBit) has its own import functionality.&nbsp; I was able to paste the key into a file which I imported into MultiBit.<br /><br />Based on that, the command line option apparently won&#039;t work (I just tried it) because that apparently must use the bitcoin daemon, which is not used by MultiBit.<br /><br />Did that help?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just discovered MultiBit has a &quot;reset block chain and transactions&quot; option...perhaps that&#039;ll take care of things.&nbsp; I just started it, so I&#039;ll see.</div>
