					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Every major exchange has verification tiers. If you want to deal with fiat money i.e (use bank deposits and withdrawals) you will be asked for more personal info:<br />mainly Government issued ID and a recent proof of residence is needed.<br /><br />Full name, date of birth, country and phone number are required only to unlock base functionality of an exchange: <br />usually it allows you to trade and withdraw/deposit cryptocurrency but not withdraw fiat money.<br /><br />More info here: https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/201352206-What-are-the-Verification-Tiers- (https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/201352206-What-are-the-Verification-Tiers-)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When you want to buy bitcoin with Coinbase yeah you need such verification. I don&#039;t remember exactly but i saw somewhere that Coinbase wants to access webcam users for selfie also. But if you are planing to just use it as a wallet, without buying, then there is no need of verification of anything, unless they changed recently with their latest changes (fees,ect) And yes it&#039;s called KYC/AML policies and lot of exchanges have no choices to apply thoses rules</div>

If you care about decentralization, then best option will be to go for a desktop client such as Core. <br /><br />Only downside for people in this case is that it requires them to download the entire blockchain, plus it&#039;s growing on a monthly basis ~ reducing your HDD space slowly but steadily.<br /><br />But on the other hand, it will allow you to run a full node. It will help keeping the network a bit more decentralized.</div>

Bitcoin is not a market because of anonymity. Dash and Monero are anon coins. Bitcoin is a market mostly because of speculation and the future of currency.

You must not reveal to anyone your account so that you will not be expose and not pertaining to the wallet site itself. Being anonymous is not an act of suspecting where you have been registered with any site account but the most important thing is you keep the confidentiality yourself.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would also be worried about a possible leak of ID&#039;s, but fortunately most exchanges that require a an ID scan allow you to put watermarks all over it or scan it with a lower resolution, so it can&#039;t be reprinted and used by criminals. If you&#039;re worried about a possible loss of anonymity then you have nothing to fear. In today&#039;s world we have no anonymity. All our activity leaves an internet footprint, and footprints create a path that someone can follow. Many people were found through doxes, because once in their lifetime they registered a domain or had a social media account. An exchange is just another point of leakage. </div>
