					Post by: <b>Flodner</b> on <b>August 24, 2018, 09:36:28 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi All,<br />Recently I renewed the subscription of analytical software which I was using a while ago when I was more actively involved in online marketing.<br />So I decided to run report for Bitcointalk.Org and share it with you, along with some interesting observations.<br /><br /><a href="http://cryptotexty.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bitcointalk1.png">http://cryptotexty.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bitcointalk1.png</a><br /><br />As you can see BitcoinTalk is #2279 in Ahrefs rank. They rank sites based on size and quality of the backlink profile so Bitcointalk is #2279 among all the existing sites. (For example #1 is facebook, #2 is Twitter, Google is #7, complete rank you can check here (https://ahrefs.com/ahrefs-top). This number is very good, taking to account how many huge websites exist nowadays <br /><br />Bitcointalk has 24 million+ of backlinks, and is ranking by the number of 1.2Million+ keywords.<br />Bitcointalk has more than 1 million monthly organic traffic (traffic which comes from search engines, of course overall traffic is much bigger) <br /><br />PDF site overview is available by the link (http://cryptotexty.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bitcointalk.org-24-Aug-2018_08-59-49-e3a444a0d2f627152e6b22b284551bc5.pdf)<br /><br />Now, regarding organic traffic it is interesting to check which keywords are bringing the most traffic to Bitcointalk, which keywords are in the top.<br /><a href="http://cryptotexty.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bitcointalk2.png">http://cryptotexty.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bitcointalk2.png</a><br /><br />To be honest I was surprised to see that #1 is not &quot;bitcointalk&quot; (which is the second) but &quot;superchillin&quot; which brings 15,466 monthly visitors. <br />Another keyword which I didn&#039;t expect is in Russian &quot;&#1087;op&#1085;o&#1083;a&#1073;&quot; (pornlab) which brings 2,7K+ visitors a month<br /><br />I did also a report in CSV with 1000 keywords, you can find them here (http://cryptotexty.com/wp-admin/upload.php?item=327)<br /><br /><br />And here is the &quot;Top pages&quot;, in a way this section correlates with Top keywords. <br /><br /><a href="http://cryptotexty.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bitcointalk3.png">http://cryptotexty.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bitcointalk3.png</a><br /><br /><br />I hope this data was useful, let me know your thoughts</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As a person with a decent background with online marketing(SEO, etc), honestly my mind is blown due to the data you&#039;ve given.<br /><br />1. 24 million backlinks. The online marketer&#039;s dream.<br />2. A sort of random topic post that barely has any replies to it has the highest keyword volume here on bitcointalk. Like what the hell. I was expecting something along the lines of &quot;bitcoin wallet safety&quot; or &quot;What is an airdrop&quot; or something like that but instead the highest is &quot;SuperChillin.&quot; 83,000 in volume too! Compared to &quot;bitcointalk&quot; only at 15,000. That&#039;s definitely a significant difference. Baffling, for sure.</div>

It doesn&#039;t even seem like something that should be racking up that huge of a volume. Googling &quot;superchillin&quot; and taking a look at the first page&#039;s results doesn&#039;t even give you a clear idea on what superchillin actually is. Definitely quite fishy.</div>

Even bounty threads and stupid comments from the point of search engines they generate content<br />Also lots of reputable sources link to Bitcointalk threads (i.e. on most of cryptos on Coinmarketcap there is a link to BTT ANN thread)<br /><br /></div>

Although, it isn`t #1, but #9 and refers to the topic mentioned by TryNinja (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1544740.0). What is striking, &#039;bitcointalk&#039; is not even under the second, but under the third number. <br /><br />&#039;Claymore&#039; is #10. And #1 is &#039;generalt&#039; which refers to this account (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=354479). <br /><br /><a href="https://d.radikal.ru/d16/1809/1c/603e592dbea9.png">https://d.radikal.ru/d16/1809/1c/603e592dbea9.png</a><br /></div>

I think, it&#039;s a good sign. And it was surprising for me, too, to find out that out of top 10 keywords bringing traffic to BCT, only 3 are bitcoin-related. Others are about gaming, gambling and even porn. Looks like this forum is more about &quot;sex, drugs and rock&#039;n&#039;roll&quot;, you know&nbsp;:D<br /><br /><a href="https://preview.ibb.co/kQiNEz/talk2.jpg">https://preview.ibb.co/kQiNEz/talk2.jpg</a> (https://ibb.co/nxKvZz)<br /><br /><br /></div>

Turned out it&#039;s one of those websites where you can watch movies online for free. Again, nothing related to bitcoin or crypto&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /></div><br />Interesting that this site is closed, just read on their Reddit &quot;The website has been closed down and will not return.&quot;<br />So no wonder that Bitcointalk ranks high for this keyword and receives good amount of traffic.<br />But this will change for sure. May be in half a year I will run Ahrefs report again and will post here results, it will be interesting to compare</div>

Also, the main keyword &quot;bitcointalk&quot; and &quot;bitcoin talk&quot; has also a good growth. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I thought sperchillin wss a cold storage wallet until I read this thread. :)<br /><br />No doubt the superchilling traffic will increase as a result of this topic. So Here goes -<br /><br />Attention to all Super Chillers. Bitcoin is a great way to store and transfer wealth, and it is starting to be adopted by some of the major financial players. Read Bitcoin Talk, and grab some Bitcoin while you can. It will let you carry on chillin&#039; for a few more years.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If anyone is curious, SuperChillin was a movie streaming site. A pirated version of Netflix, with a lot more movies and TV series.<br /><br />They used the torrent to send the movies. But it had a UX more practical and easy to use than downloading the movie using piratebay. Similar to popcorntime, but without the need for software.<br /><br />Many people sold invitations to the site using Bitcoin as payment. And when it was closed many people started to sell invitations to similar sites also by Bitcoin. Since paypal seemed to block some negotiations. There are still similar websites, like xrpflix. And continue with the same scheme, someone who has an account needs to invite you.</div>

Their base of films is quite small.. </div>
