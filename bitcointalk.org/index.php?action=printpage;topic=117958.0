					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why don&#039;t you just look up the tx id at blockchain.info AND blockexplorer.com?<br />If it shows up on both sites, that guy is lying to you.<br />Kind of reminds me of nckrazze and the 400 BTC he said weren&#039;t on his wallet ::)</div>

They&#039;re websites and they can lie and have lied in the past.<br /><br />Seriously, depending on some centralized services is not a good idea. Every Bitcoin client itself has an independent view of the blockchain. &nbsp;Does the transaction in question have a bunch of confirmations (e.g. on the order of 6 per hour since you made it)? if so — it&#039;s settled. &nbsp;If the far end says they don&#039;t see it then something is broken there or you paid the wrong address, or they&#039;re scamming you.<br /><br /></div>
