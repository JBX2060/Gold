					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So I am getting along quite nicely with Bitcoin Point of Sale system to allow brick-and-mortar stores accept bitcoin.<br /><br />I would like some feedback in terms of design and features. I need some inspiration ;), you are welcome to click around and I will hold your suggestions in high regard.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />https://walletbit.com/pos/ (https://walletbit.com/pos/)<br /><br /><a href="https://cdn.walletbit.com/pos/includes/press/pos_screenshot.jpg">https://cdn.walletbit.com/pos/includes/press/pos_screenshot.jpg</a> (https://walletbit.com/pos/)<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://cdn.walletbit.com/pos/includes/pos.jpg">https://cdn.walletbit.com/pos/includes/pos.jpg</a> (https://walletbit.com/pos/)<br /><br /><a href="https://cdn.walletbit.com/includes/press/pos1.jpg">https://cdn.walletbit.com/includes/press/pos1.jpg</a> (https://walletbit.com/pos/)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Make sure that the person using that can run there own server, so they can run it on an intranet and just point my browser to that instead of going over the internet. It is a security thing. I would rather see a native app, so you can build in more security, cause if I ran a man in the middle would I be able to get enough stuff to build a url and login to empty the wallet?<br />Also how are you storing the wallet for these in a hot wallet, or in a cold wallet? <br /><br />The design is ok, not the best. I think the dark grey and light grey should be scrapped, and should be more of different colors they are too close together. The greens on the buttons are very different from the green on the + button maybe make those the same, plus the green is a little bright for the grey and black design.</div>

You will not be able to built an url or perform man in the middle attack very easy because of xss and csrf protection. I won&#039;t say you can&#039;t, but it will be very hard to perform this action. You might be thinking of InstaWallet or similar, where you get a unique url to your bitcoin wallet?<br /><br />It is built on top of WalletBit so you have all the security enhancements in placed from there, which includes Secure Card and Google Authenticator two-factor auth.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118419.msg1271983#msg1271983">Quote from: gweedo on October 14, 2012, 06:41:54 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Also how are you storing the wallet for these in a hot wallet, or in a cold wallet? <br /></div><br />There will be daily deposit of your accumulated balance to your bank account, so you could call it an enhanced cold wallet?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118419.msg1271983#msg1271983">Quote from: gweedo on October 14, 2012, 06:41:54 PM</a></div><div class="quote">The design is ok, not the best.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If this works would you look for sales reps like they do for CC processors and pay a %? Like some CC processors do a service if you refer a service and sign up they pay you X percent of the fee would you be willing to do this? I live in a popular vacation spot and I would try to help you do this for a % like the CC providers do.</div>

Thank you.<br /><br />Yes I think it is what&#039;s needed. And my plan is to work towards this goal. I think that Merchant Solutions like BitPay, MtGox and WalletBit pretty much covered the whole spectrum of online bitcoin processing and web-shop eCommerce and it is time to move on to the landscape or in others words real POS solutions based on hardware to be setup in stores.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Friendly advice:<br /><br />One of the BIGGEST things to remember in the merchant services field is that companies that are brick and mortar usually have early termination fees for leaving behind their old service (at least here in the States). So it may be advantageous to note in your website that your services are complimentary to existing merchant setups and do not require the customer to leave their pre existing services.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sell me on your product as a business that sells online. Meaning, what is the benefit of going through your service which charges a re-occurring percent fee of my overall BTC income compared to paying a programmer a one-time fee to incorporate an API to accept BTC into a pre-existing cart system.<br /><br />Seriously. As a merchant, I&#039;m open to the idea. But I don&#039;t see the benefit from a cost-savings perspective based on what I see on your website.<br /><br />My needs are simple: During the checkout process of a pre-existing cart, I want a customer to be able to choose BTC as an option of payment where the only information I need is a U.S.-based confirmed shipping address.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I also disagree with your view that Paypal is high fraud risk. Following their seller protection program, it actually is very low risk....</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">WalletBit includes all business tools, email transfers and SMS transactions free of charge via ResponsePay. Our Point of Sale system, currently in beta phase, will also be available free of charge and includes an inventory system for your online business. <br /><br />Modules ready for use in many of the most popular commerce solutions are already available. Please see https://walletbit.com/shop (https://walletbit.com/shop) for more details. We may be able to provide additional support on a case by case basis.<br /><br />In defense of Paypal being high risk, if a transaction has anything to do with Bitcoin then Paypal has a tendency to reverse that payment and block the account.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118419.msg1288201#msg1288201">Quote from: coincollectingenterprises on October 21, 2012, 06:18:02 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Sell me on your product as a business that sells online.
