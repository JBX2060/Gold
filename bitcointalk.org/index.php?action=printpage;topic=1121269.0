					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">bit-x&#039;s cloud mining is legit, the hashing power is provided by bitfury, one of the larger hashers in the mining scene. signing up requires your phone number though, but if you want a legitimate service its worth a try.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">According to Cloudmining 101&nbsp; (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=878387.0), Hashnest is a legit cloud mining company. I would highly suggest you to use Hashnest if you&#039;re looking to invest into cloud mining. However, please be aware that mining is not so profitable anymore. Thus, cloud mining is a very high risk investment. I personally bought a few hashing power from ZeusHash. The last time I check, I have not break profit yet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hashnest is ok but as long as it is cloud based, there is a certain risk.<br /><br />If you want to get more BTC, start staking some altcoins. Much safer investment and equality profitable. You keep coin offline, they mint and generate new coins. <br />It s similar to mining but no danger of someone running away with your coins. <br /><br />I personally prefer DMD Diamond, as you can see from my sig, however, there are also several other interesting proof of stake coins. <br />Let me know if you have more questions or need help. </div>

This is exactly what people should expect from cloud mining. If you choose good you will get close to getting your money back, some of you might even make it and reach ROI. The problem is that at that point you will still be losers because getting your money back is not an achievement. I could lend money to a friend for free, get it back after 6 months and have no profit, just like you cloud miners, but I will at least be happy knowing that I helped someone.
