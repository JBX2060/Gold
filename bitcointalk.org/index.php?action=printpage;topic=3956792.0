Almost 20% markup even on the best priced cards, definitely not worth it. You can get much better rates on localbitcoins, selling for bank transfer.<br /><br />This is why research should be always done on any purchase from a site that online, that you haven&#039;t used before. You can&#039;t trust a stranger to deliver on their promises all the time.</div>
