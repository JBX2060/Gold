					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So yesterday I sent over 23 BTC to an online wallet.<br /><br />I did not see the bitcoins in the address even after 80+ confirmations<br /><br />It&#039;s been over 18 hours and I still don&#039;t see my coins. &nbsp;Could the online wallet me corrupt?<br /><br />EDIT: Heres the address<br />http://blockchain.info/address/14K5txMuPXM6kDC3W5ZTmg5qzGA6Z8n5qY<br />NONE of those transactions are showing,</div>

If it shows the coins there and they&#039;re not on the online wallet that&#039;s a problem you&#039;ll have to solve with your online wallet provider.</del><br /><br />I just hope you&#039;re not using TorWallet...<br /><br />EDIT: I see you posted the blockchain.info link.<br />You should contact your online wallet provider support and tell them about it. They&#039;re the only ones who can help you now.<br /><br />And by the way, are you sure that&#039;s really your online wallet address? Strange things have happened before and people sent coins to wrong addresses.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The guy who runs Torwallet is somehow missing or it was a scam, and if people try to withdraw<br />coins they just get an error message...<br /><br />From the link you posted you see the transaction seems to be fine, coins are sitting there.<br />Only the provider of the online wallet can help you here.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Probably it is a Silk Road.<br /><br />The Silk Road have very good technical support. Once my coins did not appear on Silk Road account but the support was able to fix that.</div>
